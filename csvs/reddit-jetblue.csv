This flight was the worst one Ive ever flown.  This was a 7+ hour flight with no power outlets and no IFE.  At that point id had it with AA.

So for my fall SFO trip, I decided to give JetBlue a try.  However this meant giving up the direct flight and connecting through BOS.  Totally worth it because:

- The gate agents seem to actually care about their customers (Unlike the AA agents who seem to be more interested in their iPhones)

- The on board entertainment options are fantastic (and POWER OUTLETS!) 

- The flight attendants actually seem to care about their jobs (as evidenced by the ""service first"" attitude)

All in all, I hope B6 shows PHL some love in the future with more flights as I will definitely fly them again.

"First time posting, On Mobile. Hope this is the right place to post, sorry for formatting, spelling, grammar, etc. 

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay. 

But Hey, at least I got a meal voucher for $8 that doesn't work at McDonald. That I can't use until the restaurants open in like 6 hrs. So ill starve instead.  /s

"Do Jetblue corporate employees get access to crazy vacation deals? My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months. Judy claims she doesn't get anything out of it, I would almost believe this more if she just admitted she gets a % cut. Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal. Something just doesn't smell right and I'm wondering if there are any current or former JB corporate employees out there that can vouch for getting amazing vacation deals that can be shared with friends.

"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed. 

Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.

Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

"I flew from San Francisco to NYC on on December 18th which is when I made the baggage claim. They haven’t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don’t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don’t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they’d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can’t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don’t know what to do. I’m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don’t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don’t know what to do at this point.

"I encountered the worst air travel situation yet recently and that's after traveling a bit over the past several years.  I never before had issues with Jetblue, but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again.  Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once, several times, then the final returning leg, after being delayed multiple times, even while sitting on the airplane for an hour, was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening.  This forced me, my co-passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded.  Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options, which is ridiculous.  Many were families with small children, and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were, we were told ""their"" hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves, but they would provide transportation.  There's much more to this, but long story short, I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason, but I still find it reprehensible I was put in this position.

Tonight I’ll be taking my first jetBlue flight to Las Vegas. I’ve heard by other people that passengers can watch TV on their planes.

"I have 2 questions. 

1) There was a scedule change on a returning flight after I booked it, and as well as the scedule change, it apparently also dropped price, but no one seems to be able to honor that the difference should be a travelbank credit, although I may be mistaken. What's the best way to get that applied?

2) Is there any way to know before if I am flying a renovated A320, and if not, are the chances relatively low at this point in time?",1,1528965435.0,8qxk4m,1,Renovated A320,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/8qxk4m/renovated_a320/,2018-06-14 04:37:15
"For the most part, my experience on jet blue has always been professional.  On today’s flight, before the safety announcement, the flight attendant said “listen up to the safety announcements unlike the southwest passengers.”  I mean a person died on that flight.  Not really something to be joking about.  Not the end of the world, just really weird IMO.  ",2,1524573758.0,8ehvcq,1,Too soon?

"I know the chances of this happening is non-existent, but I wanted to share my dilemma...

I'm flying to the Bahamas in May for my birthday. The LAX-FLL offers MINT. I haven't picked my seat yet, and I heard that if you kindly ask at the boarding gate, they'll either:

a) Advise you that a MINT flight is available and you'll pay the difference. 
b) Tell you that there's no seats available.
C) Laugh and tell you to go flu a kite.

Now here's the kicker: I love Jetblue and to show my appreciation,  I'm giving some chocolates as a thank you to the entire crew. I know that this seems like a bribe, but they're getting it regardless.

I am going to ask and see what happens. :fingers crossed: Any other tips?",1,1522298567.0,87vdxb,1,Has anyone received a free MINT upgrade?,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/87vdxb/has_anyone_received_a_free_mint_upgrade/,2018-03-29 00:42:47

"Hey guys. I was just trying to check out using points for a round trip jetblue flight coming up next week. As I was checking out I noticed I was only 124 points short and so, instead of paying for a ticket, I bought 1000 more points for $37. Well during the purchase process I was kicked out of the website due to my login timing out. When I logged back in my points purchase had gone through but the points requirement for my flight shot up from roughly 2600 points to over 20,000.
