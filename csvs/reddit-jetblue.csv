This flight was the worst one Ive ever flown.  This was a 7+ hour flight with no power outlets and no IFE.  At that point id had it with AA.

So for my fall SFO trip, I decided to give JetBlue a try.  However this meant giving up the direct flight and connecting through BOS.  Totally worth it because:

- The gate agents seem to actually care about their customers (Unlike the AA agents who seem to be more interested in their iPhones)

- The on board entertainment options are fantastic (and POWER OUTLETS!) 

- The flight attendants actually seem to care about their jobs (as evidenced by the ""service first"" attitude)

All in all, I hope B6 shows PHL some love in the future with more flights as I will definitely fly them again.

"First time posting, On Mobile. Hope this is the right place to post, sorry for formatting, spelling, grammar, etc. 

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay. 

But Hey, at least I got a meal voucher for $8 that doesn't work at McDonald. That I can't use until the restaurants open in like 6 hrs. So ill starve instead.  /s

"Do Jetblue corporate employees get access to crazy vacation deals? My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months. Judy claims she doesn't get anything out of it, I would almost believe this more if she just admitted she gets a % cut. Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal. Something just doesn't smell right and I'm wondering if there are any current or former JB corporate employees out there that can vouch for getting amazing vacation deals that can be shared with friends.

"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed. 

Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.

Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

"I flew from San Francisco to NYC on on December 18th which is when I made the baggage claim. They haven’t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don’t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don’t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they’d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can’t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don’t know what to do. I’m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don’t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don’t know what to do at this point.

"I encountered the worst air travel situation yet recently and that's after traveling a bit over the past several years.  I never before had issues with Jetblue, but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again.  Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once, several times, then the final returning leg, after being delayed multiple times, even while sitting on the airplane for an hour, was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening.  This forced me, my co-passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded.  Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options, which is ridiculous.  Many were families with small children, and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were, we were told ""their"" hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves, but they would provide transportation.  There's much more to this, but long story short, I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason, but I still find it reprehensible I was put in this position.

"I know the chances of this happening is non-existent, but I wanted to share my dilemma...

I'm flying to the Bahamas in May for my birthday. The LAX-FLL offers MINT. I haven't picked my seat yet, and I heard that if you kindly ask at the boarding gate, they'll either:

a) Advise you that a MINT flight is available and you'll pay the difference. 
b) Tell you that there's no seats available.
C) Laugh and tell you to go flu a kite.

Now here's the kicker: I love Jetblue and to show my appreciation,  I'm giving some chocolates as a thank you to the entire crew. I know that this seems like a bribe, but they're getting it regardless.

"Hello everyone,  
I have applied to the Gateway Select program for JetBlue and have been selected to take their assessment. This is directed to those that have completed the program, are in the program currently, or have taken the test itself.  What exactly can I expect from the assessment?  Is it more aviation related or is it more general education related (like ACT/SAT.) I have done a lot of research on the program itself and for me the costs are not going to be (that) much of an issue. But I want to ensure that I do well on this assessment.  If anyone has any information for me (or even some practice tests that I could take) that would be absolutely fantastic and very much appreciated!  Thank you so much in advance.

"This post will detail my experience with the application process (and hopefully even further).

Found out about gateway select earlier this year, couldn't find much info on the process as I researched (found two helpful posts on r/flightsim and r/flying). Obvi it started in 2016 so there isn't much info to be found other then what's on the web page (http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select/training). 

Submitted my application, resume, and cover letter Sept 24 2017.
Received an email on Oct 4 stating I've been selected for the next round of the application process.
This involved signing up for a $160 aptitude test at a testing center and to have the test completed by Oct 15. Just returned from that test and decided to make this post as I went in to it blind. You've got three hours and 4 test segments:

1. Multitasking: watch and interact with a flight sim, with limited direction on what the test comprises of. Keep track of audio directions (and how many individuals give you those directions), keep track of how many times there is a chiming noise, keep track of how many times a red light turns on. You also will have to click a button everytime you see air traffic or pass over a waypoint (you will be asked at what point you saw the helicopters and what the last way point looked like). While all this is happening you use the up and down arrows in a mini-game where you navigate a plane past oncoming rectangles. AND you have a few seconds to assess and answer quick math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition questions. The Sim ends and you answer the questions about how many chimes and how many people, what the last check point looked like, how many aircraft you saw, where in the route was the airfield, what the cockpit looked like and where the guages were. You make an assesment of how hard all that was and rate yourself on how well you did. Then you do the sim again. Slightly different, except this time you know what you're looking for.

2. Math, spacial reasoning, and pattern recognition:
Worst math was an algebra question (something like, (y-12)÷14=9). Spacial reasoning and pattern recognition are timed events, gotta be quick to answer or it counts as wrong.

3. Reacting to confrontation:
Questions like ""you see a couple arguing, the woman is trying to get away but the man has a hold of her arm and keeps pulling her back. Do you A B C or D?"" All the questions were how you'd react in a confrontation either involving you or getting involved with others.

4. Personality test:
Basic personality test. Questions like ""I work well with others."" ""Individual performance is more important then group success."" Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree.

The test results come back same day via email.

Next up will be a phone interview if they like the test results.
After that is an in person interview.

Will post as I move thru the process. 
This is an informative post about the process; discussions on program details and cost exist on other threads. Have not seen anything detailing NDA on what the test is made of. Dm me if this violates any policy that may jepordise my applicant eligibility.

(Fist post on Reddit, ever. Plz dm any tips/criticisms/correct place to post)

"I was thinking how it would be neat to buy an aircraft passenger seat just because it would be fun to sit in and a neat decoration. Where can I buy any aircraft seat, used or new? I am also curious of what airlines do with all those seats. If JetBlue is refurbishing all of their a320s with new seats and they have 130 a320s with 150 seats, that’s a whole lot of seats they have to get rid of. What happens to these seats and where do you think I can get one of these seats from any airline or company?

"Passed my instrument checkride today with DPE Fred Reeb. Super cool guy. He's a Jetblue captain and former FAA inspector, so I felt a little bit more proud of myself. No fuss or drama - everything was very straightforward. I was quite anxious before and during the oral (Fred even told me to calm down and relax a couple times) but aside from having to look up a couple things on legends or in FAA publications, it went really smoothly. Most of the oral revolved around our cross country plan. He was very focused on the weather and would give me lots of different scenarios with different weather conditions. For systems he simply asked questions like what are the gyroscopic instruments, what are the pitot static instruments and what could happen if the pitot tube gets blocked, etc. He also asked questions like what instruments need to be checked before VOR flight, and show me that they have been complied with. I'd say the vast majority of the oral was weather focused. Fred definitely wants you to understand the value of a thorough weather briefing before taking off.

The flight was another story. For whatever reason, SoCal approach seemed to be having an off day. Fred even got on the radio at one point to explain that he was doing an examination and they got more accommodating after that, but it really made me flustered and I felt I was doing a poor job. Filed IFR from KLGB-KFUL. Took off and got radar vectored to the FUL RNAV 24. Did unusual attitudes along the way. Shot the approach with the published missed and a lap in the hold, then outbound on the FUL VOR-A approach (full procedure with the turn) partial panel. Came back in and circled for 24, then after getting established on final went around and got radar vectors for the ILS 30 back into LGB. Kept myself within a half dot deflection on both localizer and glide slope and greased the landing. Probably the best ILS approach I've ever shot.

Overall it was a solid checkride and I would definitely recommend Mr. Reeb for any checkride. Nothing out of the ordinary and aside from the issues with SoCal approach, a smooth experience.

"I flew into JFK VFR yesterday in a Piper Cherokee Dakota. It's been a bucket list item for a while.

https://i.redd.it/a2r225tck4d31.png

Prep: I called 1-800-WX-Brief, and that was the best decision I could have made. They offered to call Kennedy Tower, and tower told them it was more of a TRACON issue as I'd have to get sequenced into the flow. The briefer got back to me and then called TRACON.  They said it was not an issue, but bring gas, b/c a delay of 30 mins was likely.

Flight in: I flew from Blairstown NJ (1N7) and after takeoff contacted NY approach to request flight following to JFK.  I specifically asked for clearance into the Bravo to hopefully get on the ‘radar’ for sequencing.  I was told they were going to route me over LGA, and eventually told that there would be a 30 min delay via vectors.  I asked if I could do the skyline route while I waited, but that turned out to not be an option b/c of the way LGA traffic was landing. When switching to another NY Approach controller, he asked if we were really planning on landing JFK...I replied we were.  After 15 mins of flying east, I was vectored south toward Fire Island.  At that point they vectored me in a large pattern for JFK, with a 10 mile final for 22R.  When switched over to tower they informed me there was a 3 degree offset for the parallel runway, so I corrected and came in at a bit of an angle to separate from parallel traffic.  I kept the speed up on final, and didn’t pull power or put in flaps until late in the process.  A 757 was landing on the parallel runway at the same time we were. It was fun seeing all the big iron waiting for us to land!  After landing, the hardest part was taxiing.  I had looked at the diagram, but it’s confusing for the first time pilot.  The taxi instructions came in fast, and it was a long taxi over to the FBO (Sheltair).  When I got to the ramp, there was a 747 Atlas Air somewhat blocking the entrance.  After talking to Ground and Sheltair, I gingerly made my way past the 747...with my wing passing under his.  He eventually taxied out, but we felt the jet blast as he exited.  Trickier than I had expected.

https://i.redd.it/k02gp7srk4d31.jpg

At JFK: Sheltair had a minivan waiting for us, and took me to the FBO and my passenger off to his terminal at JetBlue (more on that in a sec).  They were great, but the fueling took about 3x longer than normal.

Flight out: Talked to Clearance Delivery and requested a 1500’ and a route to the Verrazano Bridge to do the skyline route to Teterboro and then direct to my home field.  They gave me instructions to expect vectors to 8 miles west of JFK and to stay at or below 1400. Fair enough.  Started up, and got taxi instructions.  Ended up in a line of jets.  About a dozen in front, and as we got to the front waiting to take off on 22R there were a dozen jets behind us.  We were the only piston aircraft I saw the entire time there.  Taxiing to get in line was about 10-15 mins and the wait was at least 30 mins to take off.  One interesting thing was that we were switched over to tower just before we got in line...so at least 30 mins prior to take off.  While we were waiting the Delta pilots behind us were waving, and clearly enjoyed seeing little Piper in front of them.  My cousin was watching us from the terminal, and got a comical shot of us in line.  Finally got to #1 position, and were told to position and hold.  Got clearance, and took off with instructions to follow runway heading until reaching the south shoreline and then head west.  Did that, and they turned me loose - I was expecting further flight following, but can’t complain.  Took the VFR corridor North up the Hudson and then back home.  It was a fun trip with lots of little challenges.  I’m glad I did it.

NY Approach, JFK Tower, Ground, Clearance Deliver and the briefer at 1-800-WX-Brief could not have been more helpful or professional.  I appreciate their help in making this trip happen.

Tips: Expect delays - bring gas.  Plan on landing and taking off before 3p - which is tough given how long the delays are (on the ground and in the air). You’re going to spend a minimum of $100 just to land.  Be on your radio game, and have a taxi diagram ready to go on the ground.  ~~If you can, go IFR.  I think that would have made the process a little faster/easier.~~  (edited based on u/JRu14 comment below).

"I am a 28 year old student pilot living and working in the greater Boston area. I fly for work already (flight attendant) and I have been “working” on my PPL since spring of 2018. I’ve had a couple of bumps in the road already, who hasn’t had them. Being a commercial airline pilot is my ultimate goal. I know things change and people don’t always achieve their goals but I’m still trying. I have about 19 hours, pre solo, on my second school and third instructor. I work full time and don’t make a whole lot. So it’s currently not financially possible to get the hours in I want to each week. I’m at a point in my life with my age and goals, I need to make a leap or give up on the dream of being an airline pilot.  Which obviously doesn’t mean I can’t still obtain ratings and licenses but it would be at a different time 

(If you disagree with me that’s fine but this is how I feel) 

So I’ve begun looking into several different routes. 

1. Jetblue Pilot Gateway Select program
2. American Airlines cadet program
3. ATP/American flyers
4. Take out loan, stay in Boston and at my current job but work part time and buckle down to finish at home at my current school. 

I’m scared to make the wrong decision, as anyone would be since it’s a big decision financially and 3/4 of those would require a decent distance move. Please share experiences positive and negative with me! Advice or other options are always welcome.

"Just for a bit of background, I'm in my early 30's with a wife and a small child (under 5 years). I've been bouncing around jobs year to year, and no matter what I do, I always come back to the idea of flying as a career.  I've read the faqs and various aviation forums, and I don't expect to make $70k out the gate nor a favorable flight schedule for the first 5-7 years. However my main question is which path to I take to become an airline pilot?

1. College: I live relatively close to Baylor University and they offer a Aviation Air Sciences degree. I've talked the director of the program and I can peruse a double major so I can also peruse a degree that would be useful outside the aviation sector. I know Aviation degrees are suspect but Baylor is a good school in it's own right and they do have an FAA approval of a 500 hour reduction to be eligible to be hired by a regional airline. [Baylor Link](https://www.baylor.edu/aviation/)
2. Technical School: Also in the Waco area is Texas State Technical College (TSTC). They also offer a flight program but only as a Associates Degree. It's more cost effective than Baylor, but it starts to run into the same issues that surround ATP in terms of quality and they way they do business. [TSTC Link](https://www.tstc.edu/programs/AircraftPilotTrainingTechnology)
3. Private Flight School: Down in College Station is Brazos Valley Flight Services. They seem to be highly regarded and do training up to CFI Instrument rating. It is also the most affordable and flexible option, but with my age, I think I would need to commit full time instead of trying to work flight time around working and family time. [BVFS Link](https://bvfs.net/)
4. JetBlue Gateway Program: I know this isn't a guaranteed option as there is an application process to get into the program, and it is very expensive, but it does offer a guaranteed (gateway select program) position as a first officer with JetBlue at the end of the program.  [JetBlue Link](http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select)
5. Lufthansa Group Gateway: I also happen to be a dual-citizen with an European Union nation. This is very similar to the JetBlue program expect I'll have to move to Germany first, assuming I get selected into the program. [Lufthansa Link](https://www.european-flight-academy.com/en)
6. Get a STEM Degree and just get my PPL: I've mostly toyed with this idea since I know getting into the industry is a grind for the better part of a decade and maybe getting a hard-sciences degree that affords me the income to peruse flying as a hobby rather than a job might be the way to go, but ultimately I have no idea if this with result with me in the same position I'm in right now.

Any and all insight, comments, criticisms, etc. are welcome. It all boils down to I'm tired of bouncing around jobs and want to lock into a career. If I was 20 and single it'd be a no brainer for me, but at 32 and with a family I'm hesitant and just looking for an unbiased opinion on what my next step should be.",9,1565264682.0,cng5w4,2,Contemplating this career path,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/cng5w4/contemplating_this_career_path/,2019-08-08 07:44:42
"I earned my PPL last year and decided if time travel were an option, I’d go into military aviation. Since I’m 28 now and beyond the age for that, I’d like to know what are my options to become a pilot through something like the JetBlue Gateway program? I already have a PPL so would there be any company willing to train me from that point. I keep hearing a pilot shortage, so I’m hoping that means some kind of incentives for pilots will eventually be rolled out. I know its not the highest paying job, but I love it.",16,1508640270.0,77v6q3,2,Becoming a professional pilot through a program like JetBlue Gateway?,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/77v6q3/becoming_a_professional_pilot_through_a_program/,2017-10-21 22:44:30

I have one more semester at community college and was planning on attempting to get scholarships for university (for flight school) and get a degree, join ROTC and fly for the Air Force, or figure out how to get into a cadet program. 

Does anyone know what airlines specifically offer these cadet programs? How exactly would I be able to contact them and apply? It is a long shot but I would like to see if Southwest Airlines has one available as well (since my goal is to fly for them).

"Hi guys,

A bit about myself - I just recently joined this sub and I'm a bit of a general lurker on reddit so this is one of my first posts in general. I'm currently a student pilot, I have my second-class medical and about 20-ish hours under my belt with dual-instruction (though its been about a year-and-a-half since my last lesson). I have a degree in computer science and I and debt-free with no wife/kids/house/dog. I am also not too keen on joining the military.

I'm currently in between jobs and I recently saw the Gateway Select program at JetBlue (http://pilots.jetblue.com/gateway-select). To my dismay, I saw that I missed the window to apply to this program, but it will return in 2017. I just wanted to ask you guys what is the general concensus on this kind of training? Is it worth the money (i.e. will a quickly make a return on investment once I complete the training)? Are there others like it? If I wanted to get commercial jet rating and hours would this be the best way to do it? Apologies if this has been asked before - Thanks!

Pros

4. Lacking college life/experience on poly campus

Pros

1. Pathway programs with Delta, United, Jetblue, and Sun Country
2. Actual College experience and an awesome hockey team
3. Nicer, newer aircraft
4. Great reputation

"This post is probably skirting close to the rules of this sub, but it's a story about something that could make flying a lot busier for many GA pilots.

Basically what they plan to do is to make mid-sized hybrid electric passenger planes, with up to 50 passengers, that would greatly expand the utilization of regional airports.

The idea is that things like ""noise regulations, resource requirements, and fueling costs"" have forced passenger air traffic into large airports and away from regional ones, and that their aircraft will be far quieter, require less resources, and be less dependent on fuel, so they'll enable airlines to use regional airports again.

This seems like an intriguing idea that could make the skies and the airports a lot busier for GA pilots, for good or ill.

""As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago. Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.""

> Zunum Aero hopes that the smaller airplanes, operating in less-crowded airports, without the astronomical fares of a private jet, will lower TSA wait times and open up more convenient airports.

"Edit: Id say more along the lines of intimidated rather than afraid. Was watching an ASF video on communication in terms of an accident analysis (link to video at bottom) and it got me thinking. Why are pilots afraid of atc or consider them the big bad wolf or the big stick of the faa? Is it that fear of getting a ""copy a # for tower""? Or the fear of getting an investigative or enforcment letter from the faa if pilots do not heed the controllers instructions or ""orders"" as some may say. Or if pilots inconvenience atc.  As stated in the video, ""Controllers do not control aircraft. Pilots do."" Thoughts? Opinions? Would love to hear from both the GA and 121/35 sides of the field. Also to satisfy rule 3, how would i deal with a situation in witch a ATC is using the FARs to force their agenda onto others not in the interest of safety? Such as, (if this ever occurs) giving aircraft really out of the way flight plaths not due to wx or safety.

Also heres the link to the video if interested
https://youtu.be/pAWy9mjnrYM

If you just want the synoptic, sr-20 on approach enters tight base leg,  doesnt know of other plane on 1 mile final,  atc tells pilot,  pilot does sudden left turn to avoid what he thought was a mid air collision,  turns into a spin at 2000 ft, caps deployed but too low to save aircraft.

ALSO: Why does atc seem to give priority to ""scheduled itinerint flights"" over GA? And yes i know any emergency takes priority over all flights

"I posted about someone I knew getting an offer to fly for ATCA in AZ and move directly into United, skipping the regional airlines. The post was downvoted hard, and it encouraged me to do my own research on the program. According to [APC](http://www.airlinepilotcentral.com/airlines/legacy/united_airlines)

> United has implemented a Career Path Program (CPP) with three companies: CommutAir, ExpressJet's E-145 and Airline Training Center of Arizona (ATCA). 

The ATCA program makes no mention of the regional airlines as a pathway, and when interviewing for ATCA you undergo the same process that current CPP pilots at the regionals go through (United inteview process, the Hogan exam, etc.) According to [this forum post](https://www.airlinepilotforums.com/united/96405-lufthansa-united.html) this program will be (essentially) mirroring the unpopular Cape Air - JetBlue program. [This post](https://www.airlinepilot.life/t/united-airlines-career-path-program/2320/4) also seems to confirm that UAL will be hiring people without 121 experience in the future. I also spoke with a friend who was an intern at UAL last year and he confirmed that the ATCA CPP is exceptionally competitive and that it remains *possible* for people accepted into this program to bypass the regionals.

Important to note is that this isn't a flow, or a guaranteed job. [The ExpressJet page claims United has committed to hiring 1 in 4 pilots from the CPP when these pilots become eligible.](http://www.expressjet.com/careers/pilots/pathway-programs/)

Can anyone refute this with hard fact? The evidence I have is pointing towards a regional bypass. This seems to be in line with the current regional mindset of promoting cadet CFIs over people with more 'real-world' experience with seniority, etc.",31,1490744428.0,6203j5,2,Repost: What's up with United's CPP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/6203j5/repost_whats_up_with_uniteds_cpp/,2017-03-28 19:40:28

"Without getting too much into it, I'm military pilot with a bunch of rotary wing hours, and a recent (military) transition to the fixed wing side. I'm over the ATP minimums (plus R-ATP with military) EXCEPT I'm currently finishing my 61.159 requirements.  Namely, 25 hours night, and 250 in Category.  I've got a deployment in the very near future, and when I get back towards the end of the summer, I should more than have the requirements, so I'm not concerned there.

With that said, I'm currently in JetBlue's college gateway program.  Next step is either Cape Air, or ExpressJet, leading into a final interview as an FO with JetBlue.  However, I've not been getting a warm and fuzzy about ExpressJet and don't have a huge desire to fly the C402... (especially if it could end me up in Montana for awhile).

Endeavor and the DGI program is looking rather appealing though.  It seems like they have MUCH better prospects at CA upgrades, not to mention a better shot at getting into a Legacy sooner; one that owns the carrier, for that matter.

Am I missing something?  Is ExpressJet not as bad as it's looking?  Is Endeavor not as good as it appears?",33,1482030556.0,5iw0rl,2,Advice sorting out the next step? (Which regional/path),https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/5iw0rl/advice_sorting_out_the_next_step_which/,2016-12-17 22:09:16

It is low paying (9/hour for FO, by duty hour not flight and for 40 hours a week) but something sounds really fun about flying VFR twins from Boston to the Islands back and forth.

It is pretty clear that it is two pilots keying the mic at the same time. Imagine how many things news stations report on that we might not know much about and how misrepresented they can be. Mind Blown.

"Howdy /r/Flying,

   Yesterday after another instrument lesson i was shootin' the breeze with some fellow pilots and the topic of flying to Cuba came up. We chatted at length about the pros and cons (I am hesitant to the idea) of doing such a trip. 

 One thing we could not find was when this will be legal and what would be required for the flight. I heard JetBlue was starting service to Havana July 3rd, but wasn't sure if they got a special use permit from the feds. As far as i know the only current change in the federal laws is that there are more purposes to obtain a visa, i.e. education, family, religious, artistic etc, to be able to go but you still need to be in a guided group. Have any of you heard differently about the topic?

"I'll just cut to the chase here, I have loved aviation since I was a little kid. Plane spotting, simulator, and now flying for real. I love it all and can't wait for my future in aviation. The only problem that I have is that none of my friends like, or know anything about aviation so I have no one to talk to except a few pilots from Delta Air Lines and jetBlue that I meet up with every so often. So if you like aviation, and want to talk, lets get this discussion going! Feel free to open up any threads about GA, corporate flying, commercial flying, stories, news, ANYTHING aviation related. 

I'll start a topic here --- I don't if anyone else has seen, but it seems like there have been quite a few general aviation plane crashes in these recent months. It's extremely sad, but what would you guys say is the cause? I live in Iowa and there have been 4 crashes in the last 5 months. One of which a pilot hit power lines an extreme short final to a grass strip. It just seems like Private Pilots nowadays don't use charts, TAC's or AFD's like we are taught to in flight school. And I guess all of these crashes aren't a good enough wake up call. It's unfortunate.
