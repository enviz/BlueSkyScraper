United,,,Oct-19,0,0," |  Salt Lake City to Denver. Every single time I end up flying with United I end up extremely disappointed. They have tickets that do not include a carry on. I paid $580 for a ticket and they charged me $60 to check a carry on bag. Last time I flew with them, they ripped the handles completely off of my bag. So to say I did everything in my power to not fly with them would be an understatement. To get to the airport and find out I have to check my tiny carry on bag was not good news at 4 am. I do not recommend flying with them ever.",1,1,,26th October 2019,"""$60 to check a carry on""", (United States) ,Salt Lake City to Denver,1,Economy Class,5,Business,1,1,0
United,,,Oct-19,0,0, |  Portland to Denver. Very disappointed in United Airlines! Flight delay almost 3 hours due to mechanical issues on outbound flight from DIA which resulted in loosing half a day in Denver area! Why would United not book us on the next available flight when there were still seats available? Why don't they have another plane available? Denver is a main hub and this is ridiculous when it's from the originating airport.

United,,,Oct-19,3,3," | Fort Myers to Austin via Houston. I am mortally sick of this airline. I really cannot think of anything good to say about them. Today is the third time in a row they have both been delayed by an hour or more, and forced me to check my bag, even though when I get on board, there is plenty of bin space available costing me 30 minutes on the other end of my flight, on top of the delays. Do they really have so little comprehension of bin space or communication between on plane and terminal staff? I don't have this problem with Southwest, Virgin, Delta, Alaska, just United. Honestly if I had a choice, I would use any other airline.

United,Boeing 737,,Oct-19,3,4, |  San Francisco to Palm Springs. My wife and I were on different isle seats I asked if we could be put together The gate representative said we couldn’t because our flight was full. I was a little put out and she recognized that but couldn’t help. We left and waited to board. My wife went ahead of me and I waited till last to board. When I got up to board she handed me a different boarding pass and kindly said here you go Mr Kopsho. I was presently surprised she remembered and took the time to fix a little problem in our travels. My wife was very surprised. We had a great flight thanks to a very considerate team member.

United,,,Oct-19,0,0, |  Columbus to Washington. United has by far the worst customer service of any airline I have encountered. I had issues with a cancelled flight for an international trip and was trying to re-book my connecting flight and they wanted to charge me over 200 dollars in change fees which is less than it would have cost to buy a brand new ticket.

They don’t tell you the truth instead only telling you time by time that your flight is impacted by an earlier departure. Will not take UA if I have other options in the future!

The flight was to depart at 10 am, I received a text stating a delay and the new time was 10:25 am. We were looking for assistance at 9:15 am at the airport but the person helping couldn't check us in stating we got there too late. She sent us to additional services where the same happened. They told us the doors for boarding closed at 9:50 am. We had no bags to check and security was light. They still wouldn't let us through. Just then we got another text asking us the check in. We showed the text and asked what was the problem, why were they holding us back? They offered to put us on a flight for 10/22, I stated there would be high winds tomorrow and it would probably cause more trouble. I asked for our money back but they wouldn't do anymore for us than rescheduling for the next day. We went back home which is an hour and a half away from Ohare.

United,,,Oct-19,1,1," |  Columbus to Denver via Chicago. I leave my apartment at 330p, slight traffic but get to airport at 345. Some issues finding parking so I eventually get out and make it to the United desk at 400. Flight departs at 440. I tried to check in via mobile but United won't let basic economy check in unless you check a bag for $30. So I get to the desk and try to check in via the kiosk but it said the same thing. I then ask the gate agent to check me in who noticed that I had a book bag and carry on and said I could only have 1 item. So I spend a few minutes stuffing my book bag into my regular bag, then the agent tries to check me in again and by this time it is 410p, the agent was locked out of checking me in 30 minutes before departure time. I was truly in disbelief. There was nothing anyone could do to get me my boarding pass. The gate agent then tries to get me on the earliest available way to get to Denver which would have been 930pm Denver time. unfortunately the flight to Chicago from Columbus was already delayed so I wouldn't have time to make my connecting flight. Eventually they got me into the next flight and now I won't be getting into Denver until 1047 pm Denver time. This airline tries to do whatever it can to get more money out of you and doesn’t care about passenger experience or customer service. Unfortunately this terrible airline has a monopoly on certain routes so in some cases is the only option.

United,,,Sep-19,0,0," |  San Francisco to Newark. Due to aircraft change, my friend and I were downgraded from 1st class to Economy on this leg of our Business class flight from Australia code sharing with Air New Zealand. We were appalled when given a voucher by way of compensation with so many restrictions attached as to be practically useless to Australian citizens. Beware of using any airline offering a codeshare flight on United Airlines. The substituted aircraft was dirty, smelly and delapidated with a torch hanging from the ceiling in the toilet for illumination. The battery gave out 2 hours into the flight so customers had to use their mobile phones to see and the state of the toilet attested to the fact that this method was inadequate in the extreme.

This class of service means you can’t check in online ahead, however when you arrive at the gate, you have unfriendly staff trying to get you to pay for your hand luggage continuously until you board the plane. My seat assignment was the last row against the toilet so no reclining. United basic economy awful and I hope the other airlines don’t follow this “class” of a bad idea!

United,Boeing 787-10 / 777-300ER,,Oct-19,5,3," |  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Newark. United's Boeing 787-10 is the best aircraft I have flown on a domestic route within US. My connecting flight from Newark to Mumbai was on a B777-300ER and it felt like a downgrade from B787-10. The three main differences that I experienced were:  B777-300ER had a dense 3-4-3 seating configuration with seats that felt uncomfortably narrow. Boeing 787-10 had a more responsive IFE than B777-300ER. Boeing 787 cabin felt quieter than B777-300ER. The food and service from Newark to Mumbai were outstanding, but it was quite the opposite on the return flight from Mumbai. The midflight snack was a bun with aaloo tikki inside. This would have been a delicious snack, but United served it cold instead of warming it up! Accompanying the sandwich was Parle-G biscuits. United's midflight offerings were a stark contrast to what's offered on other airlines like Emirates, Swiss, & Virgin Atlantic. On a positive note, I was impressed by United's baggage handling in Newark. Not only did United transfer my bags in a tight schedule, but I was able to track my bags on the United app.",4,7,yes,12th October 2019,"""Boeing 787 cabin felt quieter""", (Australia) ,Los Angeles to Mumbai via Newark,3,Economy Class,4,Solo Leisure,4,1,0

United,Boeing 737-800,,Oct-19,0,0," |  Puerto Vallarta to Houston. I am fully disabled, my wife has very bad knees. We requested wheel chairs as we can not walk far. When in Puerto Vallarta they had wheel chairs ready for us at front entrance into airport. When we landed in Houston there no wheel chairs waiting for us or any other Handicap people on plain. There were about 30 of us from our plain and others that were herded like cattle about 150 yds to a large elevator that is used for equipment. It took us down to the basement were we were left trying fine seats to sit in as there was enough. Me and my wife had to stand for 10 minutes before I found an abandoned cart for to sit on. They were coming every 15 min and take a few people away but they would not tell us what was going on. I asked one of the united people they just said they would get to us. In the mean time I am watching of these people who had wheel play games with each other for over 20 min. And never attempting to help the people needing wheel chair assistance. I decided me and my wife would go back up stairs for help as the seats were very uncomfortable. When we got up stairs and looking to find our way we talked to different airline staff for help with wheel chairs. Both times we waited for 15 mins. No one showed up. We then stopped and talked a man driving a cart who could barely speak English he said he could not help. We ended going through security waiting in line with everyone else and watching people in wheel chairs from other airlines being helped. we ended walking all the way to the train from concourse E. When we got of train at concourse B I seen 2 young men from united with 2 empty wheel chairs. I stopped them told them what was going on. They had people to help but they called and got permission to help to our concourse. The only way we can change the problems in big business is to have large group stop using them. When it starts hurting your pocket book United maybe you will show a little compassion.

United,Boeing 737,,Oct-19,2,2," | San Francisco to Tampa. United repeatedly forces me to check my carry on bag even though I paid for Economy instead of Basic Economy. They claim that all overhead bins are completely full, yet when I board the plane there is tons of empty space in the overheads. There is clearly no communication between the gate agents who arbitrarily decide when to force people to check bags and the actual space left on the plane. Additionally, there would never even be a problem with overhead space if the flight attendants actually monitored people who put small backpacks in the overhead space instead of under their seat. I specifically do not check a bag because I don’t want to deal with the at least 30 extra minutes to retrieve my luggage from baggage claim. This is a repeated problem and is extremely frustrating to have to wait at baggage claim after a long day of traveling in the cramped United seats.",1,1,,10th October 2019,"""repeatedly forces me to check my carry on bag""", (Australia) ,San Francisco to Tampa,2,Economy Class,2,Couple Leisure,2,1,2

That is a 1.58% exchange rate. That is totally outrageous considering the official exchange rate today is 1.36%. The cost should have been closer to $1,388CDN. I need to know how they can justify a $229 uplift on the exchange rate! I can't. I am extremely unhappy with this. I have cancelled my flights and rebooked with Expedia.com as they actually invoiced me in USD and my final cost in CDN was $1,354. Exactly where it should have been when I booked with United.

United,Boeing 787,,Sep-19,5,5," | I am forever grateful to the ground staff, administration and overall coordination of the team at United for turning a potential disaster into a wonderful trip. I have a mild seizure disorder, which resulted in an episode during our stopover from MEL at LAX to EWR. As a result, I was hospitalized for 3 days. During this time, they offered hotel and food vouchers to my wife, assisted with summoning medical attention. After spending 3 days in hospital I naturally assumed that our onward flights would be forfeited, so we re-booked. After re-booking, we received a call from United, inquiring into my health and overall condition to fly. Not only did they refund our onward booking, but upgraded my sister in-law who had flown in from NJ to assist my wife for the return journey to Newark. I have never seen this level of service or care from an airline before, and am most appreciative of their genuine concern and care that we reached our destination. I was overwhelmed that an organization of that size even knew about it, nor cared to do something about it. I have been a frequent business traveler for 10 years, and was previously a patriotic customer of Qantas. After a few nightmarish encounters (ranging from them pretending to go bankrupt in 2011, and gross mishandling of the Ash Cloud in 2010) I decided to try another airline for travel to the US. United were a breath of fresh air, with their luxurious and friendly cabin service exceeding the standards of even Emirates or Etihad. The welcoming and warm atmosphere in the cabin, combined with a delicious restaurant quality, multi-course meal (with generous portion sizes), plus the most comfortable premium cabin flat-bed seats (that I can actually sleep in, being a taller than average guy) lead to a fantastic experience.

United,,,Sep-19,0,0," |  I’m usually not one to complain on social media, but to say that I’m beyond annoyed is an understatement. We booked our honeymoon trip as a package deal through Costco travel and our flights were booked with United Airlines. The flight there, we had a short layover in San Francisco and the flight was delayed going there so we were literally running to the connecting flight. We made the flight (barely) but our bags did not, so we spent the first 24 hours of our honeymoon without our clothes or toiletries. Flash forward 10 days to our flight home, same situation delayed flight with a short layover, 20+ people were catching the same connecting flight to Chicago. I went up to the desk and overheard several other people ask about if the flight would be informed of the delay. The employee at the United desk in Maui told me that with so many people on the flight they would be informed and that the flight would be held for the 22 people catching it. Flight landed and they switched our arrival gate to the other side of the airport and sat on the runway for a good 20 minutes before we have to wait for the whole plane to deboard. 22 people are running from one side of the airport to the other only to find out that they were not informed of the delay and could not wait an 5 extra minutes for a good portion of their customers, and left without us. Customer service was a nightmare and did the bare minimum to help us with this situation that was completely their fault and one that could have been totally avoided.

United,,,Aug-19,1,1," |  Anchorage to Albany. After the first leg of our flight being delayed several hours, we did not make our connecting flight and then were rudely told by the desk agent that they didn't have time to rebook us as they were too busy. Called the 800 number and was told the only option was to wait 13 hours in Newark to get a flight to Albany and that there was only one seat so either my husband or I would have to sit in the airport overnight. To add to this, our luggage was lost as well. Finally ended up renting a car and driving nearly 5 hours home. Was then told on Aug 26 that the last leg would be refunded by a supervisor in the call center. It's 9/6 and still no refund. Called today and was told by the first inept phone agent that the refund never took place and ""I don't know why"". Spoke to a supervisor who said due to a ""system error"" it never happened and that she now processed it, but we have to wait another 7-10 business days. United Airlines has really sunk down to the lowest level of quality. I've flown with them for nearly 20 years, but the last several trips have been a nightmare. The customer service agents are clueless and read from a screen repeatedly ""apologizing for the inconvenience"", which is not the get out of jail free card for bad service that United seems to think it is.

United,A319,,Jul-19,2,2," |  I was recently booking a first-class fair on United.com on the mobile app on my phone. I had gone through the booking been quoted a price selected seats and when I went to push the button that read agree and purchase the pop-up on my screen was there was a problem completing your reservation. I subsequently contacted United immediately and they advised that all of the fares at that price had been sold out. I am traveling with two friends we were traveling together all the same flight all in first class. The United representative proceeded to tell me that the fair had increased $518. Now mind you, I wasn't surfing the web I had locked onto the seats I was quoted the price I had put in my credit card I'd selected seats and was merely pushing agree and purchase. United has turned into an awful airline. The food in first class is a laugh. You get a basket of chips on a five hour flight. At least on American you still get a decent meal. You call the call center that can do nothing which you on hold say that I speak with a supervisor and it is always a useless call for which you will wait at times a significant amount before somebody even picks up. I assume they had given up all pretense of having any loyalty. For first-class flyers there are no reward for regular flyers because they sell first-class to anyone including bidders up until the flight itself. There are no first-class seats saved to reward people who fly all the time. I have complained to United documentation the purchase prices the screenshots for my phone and I'm awaiting a response. If I could never fly United again I would. Except when they control the route, and they often do, they should be avoided at all times the customer service is essentially nonexistent. Anyone that has a good experience with United is merely lucky. Merely read the reviews you see here. I'm hoping for a successful result in a refund but I hardly think that would result in me being happy as I must get on their beat up old plane fly to Las Vegas in first-class where they were bring by a basket of chips and suggested that his first-class service.

They are labeled for a reason. No one should have multiple bags or the whole bin to themselves. This would not only save time if they were properly check but would stop individuals who are taking advantage of this system to not hold up the line and take more then one spot.

After an hour of extra waiting we finally boarded our flight to learn we had been delayed another hour. One word: O'Hare. We sat on the tarmac to learn our flight had been delayed 30 minutes. We then deplaned. We had been hanging around the gate for 5 minutes when they decided that they wanted board the whole plane again after 5 minutes at the gate. That was a waste of time, what didn't help was the front to back boarding also known as the reaper method due to the time it takes for the flight board compared from front to back which is sadly the industry standard. So our plane finally takes off and we get a small snack and an orange juice after almost 8 hrs without food. So we finally land and that's when you think it would be over. No, because of our delay there is another plane at the gate so we taxi on the runway for a full 50 minutes. Welcome to O'Hare I guess.

United,,,Jul-19,2,1," |  I am writing on behalf of my co-traveler/wife and myself regarding terrible and unbelievable experiences we had with United from Prague to LA via New Jersey EWR, on July 23, 2019. The first and second legs of our flights were with Austrian Airlines (OS 0082 and OS 0721) on July 11 and 15 which went through without a hitch and in most courteous and professional manner by Austrian. The third leg was with Czech Airlines (OK 079) on July 19 which again was also completed without a hitch. However, the fourth and fifth leg of the flight (UA 0187 and UA 2394) on July 23 were total disasters. In Prague airport, we were told that due to weather conditions the flight would be delayed approx 7 hours. Having given no other options for other United flights or otherwise, we had to wait out the delay and board the plane about 7 hours later. In New Jersey, having missed our connecting flight to LAX, again without any other options given by United, we had to stay overnight in Ramada Plaza Hotel (a virtual dump of a Hotel) for about 4 hours before returning to the airport for a 6am standby! Although vouchers were issued for the hotel (United's choice) and some food, we had to take a cab at our expense to the hotel, as no vouchers were provided, and it was very late at night. During all the interactions with United employees, customer service, supervisors, and hotel crew we were treated unprofessionally, rudely, nonchalantly, carelessly, and aggressively. At all times, the attitude of the United employees was insulting and such that they couldn't care less about our dilemma, and that they had heard these sort of complaints a million times before, that it is what it is, and basically take it or leave it. Beside suffering the aggravation and stress, the above delays, totaling a whole day, caused tremendous backlash for my wife and I, as we are both professionals with appointments and commitments to meet (which we missed), having counted on the on-time arrival in LAX. We could not even spend our food vouchers due to lack of time, and United flight crew denying our vouchers for food on the plane (EWR to LAX), and the Mexican Grill denial of vouchers in the food court of LAX arrivals. The way we see it, United has received its full payment for the tickets, but we have not received the full service promised nor have been compensated for our losses suffered. To say the least, improper actions or non-actions of United have bitterly ended a much-anticipated joyful vacation. If you have a choice, avoid United, and spare yourself lots of heartache.",1,1,,21st August 2019,"""they couldn't care less about our dilemma""", (United States) ,Prague to New Jersey via Los Angeles,1,Economy Class,1,Couple Leisure,1,0,1
United,,,Aug-19,0,0,"Cincinnati to Washington. The flight itself was fine, the pilot did a good job, the other passengers around me were great, and one of the two flight attendants (female) was very kind. My issues with this flight, which caused me great distress, stem from one flight attendant (male) who publicly humiliated me. I was traveling alone with my 16-month-old son from Cincinnati to DC – the second flight he’d ever taken in his life. He’d done pretty well on our outbound flight a few days prior (his first-ever flight); - I scheduled it around his naptime so he slept the whole time. This flight I’d scheduled around his bedtime, hoping for the same thing (that he’d sleep). In the hours before the flight while in the airport, I did everything I could to get him tired – let him run around the airport (CVG has an amazing children’s room!); gave him dinner, a snack, and a bottle; gave him Motrin in case his ears would bother him on the plane; changed him into pajamas. As soon as we got on the plane, I got him comfortable and read him a few books, which is the normal bedtime routine. It was clear after a few minutes that he had no interest in sleeping, and was very interested about what was happening outside the window and around him in the cabin, so I accepted he’d be awake for the duration of the 90-minute flight. There was an empty seat next to us, so I put his bag there so that I could easily access his books and toys to keep him occupied – which worked for the majority of the flight. The issues began when we started our descent into IAD. The fasten seat belt sign turned on, so I began gathering up my son’s toys and books into the bag to put the bag under the seat in front of us. The male flight attendant began impatiently and aggressively moving my bag under the seat before it was even zipped up. I had a ton of items in there – toys, bottles, my purse, an iPad – and I had to ask him to stop so that I could actually zip my bag so that everything didn’t fall out and potentially roll down the aisle of the plane. Then, now that the seat next to me was empty, my son was very interested in trying to get into that seat (this entire time he’d been sitting on my lap). I knew that if I continued to hold him on my lap that he would start to fuss, so I put him in the seat next to me, while holding on to him the entire time (he was never once out of my grip). The male flight attendant returned and told me it was unsafe for him to be in that seat and I would have to put him on my lap. My son was trying to stand in the seat and face the passengers behind us – granted he’s only about 30 inches tall – but the flight attendant said that if we had turbulence that he’d hit his head. I told him that I understood, but was trying to explain that he was fussing sitting in my lap, that I was trying to not disturb the other passengers, and that I had a solid grip on him. The flight attendant responded with “no, I do not think you understand” and continued to berate me for having my son in unsafe conditions. So, I put my son in my lap, and brought back out all the books I had packed away in my bag, in addition to the iPad and my iPhone, to see if he’d remain calm in my lap. No dice. My son began to cry and scream and try to wiggle out of my grasp, because he wanted to sit in the seat next to me. The flight attendant returned, saying that I needed to “get control of my child.” I explained to him all the things I was doing, and asked him what else he wanted me to do. He did not respond to my question, walked off, and that was the last time I saw him on the flight. My son continued to be unhappy and cry (and in my opinion, be more unsafe, because I was constantly having to adjust my grip on him to keep him in my lap) for the remainder of the flight. I’m the daughter and granddaughter of pilots. I’ve been in planes all my life. I understand plane safety more than the average person, and would never allow myself or my child to be in an unsafe position on a plane. I also greatly care about the comfort of others around me (I even brought extra earplugs with me and offered them to the people sitting around me), and was very upset that my son caused their flight experience to be subpar because he was so noisy. However, I am most upset by the blatant shaming of this flight attendant, who came to me on three separate occasions to berate me, the way I was managing my child, and how I was affecting other passengers. His words and actions brought me to tears in public, and I cannot believe that someone who is employed to attend to passengers on a flight would have so little compassion for a mother flying solo with her young child, who was clearly trying to follow the rules, and clearly struggling. In the future, I’ll literally take any other flight possible other than United or Mesa.

Cost just over $3000 round trip for the ticket and not with it. Firstly - I was denied access to the lavatory right in front of me, mind you I did not have to pass through or by Polaris cabin. The fact that the toilet was not available to premium plus cabin customers would have been ok if that was the policy except that everyone else in my cabin was using it and even economy class customers. On asking why I was denied the flight attendant rudely replied to use the lavatory at the back in economy where my seat was although I indicated it was in premium plus. Secondly, the meal I was served was the same as economy class although it was advertised to be the same as Polaris. The economy class packaged meal was cold as a dog’s nose, the bread was stale and crumbling apart - and when I told the flight attendant, mind you I mentioned that I knew it was not her fault and would be happy with a snack or some chips to which she said no, she went on to Insult me and said that it was my fault that the meal was cold to my amazement? I immediately thought to myself - I just be in the twilight zone! She then signals to other flight attendants and points at me in an aggressive manner. At no time was I disrespectful or raised my voice. Now this made me very embarrassed and concerned for my safety so After declining to participate in any further refreshments out of fear and sitting quietly in my seat for 10 + hours into the flight, the flight attendant comes up to me and asks why I did t eat or drink anything for the approx. 12 hour flight and if I wanted anything just when the pilot instructs to fasten seatbelts for us to land.

United,Boeing 787 Dreamliner,,Jul-19,5,3," | This is the first time I have flown the new Polaris Business Class on an international route SFO/PVG, Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I have flown back and forth to Asia many times on other Asian carriers, 4 times in the last year. Check-in in San Francisco was quick and efficient. I was given a priority pass for the security line which helped bypass the long lines. The Polaris business class lounge at SFO is one of the best in the world. Boarding the flight was on time with a separate line for business class. The flight attendants were very welcoming and professional. The business class seating on the Dreamliner was 2x2x2, all with double pods. There is some degree of separation. The seats were comfortable, but in the fully flat bed configuration, my feet were touching against the end of the pod in a small opening which cramped my feet together and I am 5'10"" tall. A taller person would find this very uncomfortable. I was sitting in 3B and I am a million miler flown on United. However, my first choice meal selection was not available as they had run out? The IFE selection is excellent, one of the best in the industry, but the television screen is fixed to the seat in front of you and cannot be tilted or moved. If you recline your seat and are looking at the screen at an angle, the quality of the screen diminishes and looses color and contrast. The overall trip was comfortable and ontime. I would have to say the flight was good, but not great. The Asian carriers flying the same route offer a much higher level of privacy with individual pods and larger beds and the quality and selection of food and service is outstanding.",5,8,yes,20th July 2019,"""flight attendants were very welcoming and professional""", (United States) ,San Francisco to Shanghai,3,Business Class,5,Solo Leisure,3,1,0
United,,,Jul-19,0,0, |  Houston to Norfolk. Customer service with United Airlines is atrocious! They have called me 6 times since I booked my son's flight on Saturday. I have used them for his unaccompanied minor flights for summer visitation for years as they have a direct route. I have always paid the unaccompanied minor fee the week of the flight as this is easier on my budget. Apparently this policy has changed unbeknownst to me. I verified at the time of the purchase of the ticket that I could in fact pay for the fee later and the manager said this was fine. This was of course not documented as were none of my 6 conversations that followed. They repeatedly asked me the same questions and I gave them the same answers day after day with no results. They refused to send me an email receipt for the ticket that I had paid for until the unaccompanied minor fee was paid. I will be using a different airline no matter the price difference. This has eaten up hours of my time due to horrible communication and customer service. If they had communicated a policy change in the first place I would have either paid for the entire thing at once or shopped for another ticket.,0,1,,20th July 2019,"""Customer service is atrocious""", (United States) ,Houston to Norfolk,0,Economy Class,0,Family Leisure,1,0,0

United,A320,,Jul-19,0,3," | Vancouver to Denver. I have to wonder what United airlines in Vancouver is thinking when it comes to customer service! Upon arriving to the Vancouver airport, we went through the self-service kiosk and tagged our bags. They had the wheelchairs locked up so we had to wait on someone to unlock them for my father. Then we were expected to drag our own checked bags about 75 yards to a conveyor belt where we had to load them to be sent off to the plane. This would not have been so bad except we had a wheelchair with no assistance and there were a lot of United personnel standing around talking and doing nothing. They also had everyone wait in the same line for all concourses which took quite a while. I am amazed that such a large airline would have such little customer service especially for loyalty customers (my parents) with today’s poor customer service, they will never get me as a loyalty passenger/customer. Once we arrived to our destination, I was not at all surprised that there was no wheelchair waiting for us as requested in Vancouver. With their outrageous pricing, you think UA would be able to afford better service. I will not book on United again unless they are the absolute only airline to a destination I want and even then I may need to choose another place to visit.

After my second flight was canceled, I found an agent and asked to have myself re booked to the 7am flight the following day. However, the exceedingly snippy agent was very difficult and unhelpful. When I finally got her to confirm that I would be on that flight, she then made a stink about getting my bag off of the plane. It took over 3 hours to get my bag, which only even happened because a kind baggage attendant took it on herself to help me (agents were refusing customers service and this happened to several others). Once I had left the terminal, I was informed that there would be no flights the following day, and that I would have to wait yet another day to get to my destination. I infuriatingly accepted this compromise. Yet the next day, I learned that an agent had gone into the system, and labeled me as a “no show” for a flight that was scheduled for the following day! I hadn’t shown up to a flight that hadn’t even happened yet!

United's new app works really well, great for check-in, changing flights, buying internet, changing seats etc I download boarding passes and was through TSA Pre-check swiftly at EWR. Polaris Lounge excellent, reasonable food offering, quality drinks, nice shower room. Lounge was very crowded from 4pm, few seats, lines for bathroom but staff pleasant. UA boarding process was usual disorganised haphazard free-for-all with pre-board groups jostling around the gate. Plane was a retro-fitted 767-300er. Polaris business seats, comfortable, private and great to sleep on, work or watch a movie. Then you hit United's Achilles heel 'inconsistency of service' from its FA's. Some crews are professional and just know about customer service while others seem to think passengers are something to be tolerated and no-longer have a passion for their jobs. I asked the FA serving the Polaris cabin for a pre-departure drink and was told that they were not offering this service from EWR as all passengers had to board through the front left door, and thats what my seat had a bottle of water. ??? After take-off I requested the express dine so I could get to sleep quickly, when the first drinks service came I request two drinks a G&T and a glass of wine for my meal. The same FA I had requested a pre-departure drink from said 'she had her eye on me' loudly to the purser, which I found funny as I hadn't even secured a single drink at that stage. When United launched Polaris over two years ago there was a real effort to improve onboard food and beverage unfortunately any improvement hasn't lasted, and as the hard Polaris product in seats and lounges slowly arrives the on-board product has declined. The food was inedible, beef that was as hard as a rock and a wet watery mash potato, present like at a cheap diner. when desert was offered the same purser and FA asked me to identify if it was a coconut or apple pie?

I ended up getting on my on-time flight to Denver, but due to “weather” we were flown to Grand-Junction airport. This runway is not FAA approved and so when we landed something broke and there ended up being a mechanical issue that further delayed us an extra 9 hours in that airport. I also have Celiac disease and I was not accommodated any gluten-free food. So after about 9 hours of sitting in that terminal, we boarded a different plane and flew to Denver.

United,A320,,May-19,0,0," |  We, a family of three, flew UA1572 on 25/05/19 between Newark to Portland The check-in was made prior to arrival at the airport but faced a very long queue for baggage processing at the airport. We have three pieces of luggage to check and after very long waiting the machine did not print out the baggage tag for our third one and then it stopped working. We got help from a staff member after she took a long time helping the others who are quite uncomfortable with the system. After that we took our three pieces of luggage to the drop-off point. One of ours is 2.2 lbs above the limit. The staff, however, looked at me like I am a criminal and didn’t say a word or give any suggestions. No communication! I had to ask her what I should do and the answer is that we either need to remove some of the excess or pay for it. We chose the former and my wife did this task. In the meantime, she asked me ""where's X?"" (which is my wife), my answer is thus to point to her but that staff bluntly spoke to me that she needs the passport not the person. I think that this is bad taste or even rude and there's no customer centred service mind. We finally managed the weight issues and got all passed. The inflight service is OK with a rather friendly flight attendant. I'd suggest that if check-in can be made out of the airport why doesn’t baggage tag print can be done at the same time at home and we just tap the QR code at the check-in to get tags? This would allow more time for customers to be less clumsy and less time consuming. To me, some of the UA staff should learn more manners. We pay for their service and salaries and we are not paying to do self-service with rude manners. Currently, it's not that easy to differentiate UA form the low-cost airlines since everything is burdened upon us. The difference is thus it's higher in costs with similar or poorer service.",2,4,,10th June 2019,"""staff should learn more manners""", (United States) ,Newark to Portland,2,Economy Class,4,Family Leisure,3,1,0
United,,,Jun-19,0,0," |  Los Angeles to Norfolk via Chicago. Over the years I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the customer service of United Airlines employees. So far I haven't really had an issue with flight attendants but the counter staff seem to be getting worse with every trip I take. This trip I was actually on an American Airlines flight that was cancelled and was rebooked on a United Airlines flight by AA. My original flight was to be at 7:00 am. I was rebooked on a 10:20 am flight on UA. I went directly to UA customer service once AA had given me the informatiom via text and email. The UA staff have me what looked like a boarding pass but told me that I had to go to the gate counter to get a seat assignment before I could board. I did and proceeded to sit and wait for at least an hour after that. I boarded with the appropriate boarding group and proceeded to my seat to buckle up. Just before the doors were closed, I was called to the front and told to bring my carry ons. They proceeded to tell me I couldn't fly because they hadn't gotten the confirmation from AA. They brought my suitcase up, stood it on the floor, shoved it to roll over to me and said come on, we have to close the door. I realize a mistake had been made by AA, but I felt that if there was a problem with my reservation, there was plenty of time to realize this in the over 2-1/12 hours from when the reservation had been made to when I was kicked off the plane. If the customer service agent had indicated any problem I would have had time to resolve it. If the gate agent has mentioned it when he assigned me a seat - both instances would have allowed me to correct the situation. I can't describe it, but after the stress of the morning, and the attitude of the gate attendant that took me off the plane I was left in tears standing outside the door. She just moved past me after locking the door and never looked back or offered any guidance on what to do. I was humiliated and stranded the second time that day. I'm going back to Southwest where they have compassion and systems that work.",3,1,,10th June 2019,"""I was humiliated and stranded""", (United States) ,Los Angeles to Norfolk via Chicago,2,Economy Class,0,Solo Leisure,1,1,0
United,,,May-19,3,5," |  My wife and I were flying to Italy for a wedding. We started our travel from Austin, Texas to Newark, New Jersey. Our flight was delayed 3 hours in Austin and caused us to miss our connecting flight to Germany in Newark. Not a huge deal, we understand delays happen and it’s not anyone’s fault. That’s part of traveling. We spent a great amount of time at the customer service desk switching flights and making sure our baggage would be following accordingly. In order to stay in business class, the next connecting flight out wasn’t for another 24 hours, which is inconvenient, but again we understand. We passed the time in the United Polaris Club, which was  very nice. We finally made it to our final destination, Naples Italy, but our 4 bags did not. There is only one counter at the airport in Naples for all lost baggage. We filed our claim for our missing luggage and were told by the lost baggage rep that we would be updated within 24hrs with a status on our missing luggage. 24 hours passed and we decided to call the customer service number on our claim tag. We were unable to reach any baggage rep, the phone would ring and never was picked up. We tried to call the airport directly and never made it to a live rep for assistance. We called United because it was the airline we booked our reservation through. The rep kept telling us that the baggage loss was due to Lufthansa, Star Alliance Partner, so we would have to call that airline for assistance. Frustrating, but we followed the information given to us by the United rep and attempted to call Lufthansa. Lufthansa would not ever pick up the phone. 48 hours of trying to call Lufthansa, still the phone was never answered. Again, we called United for assistance with Lufthansa and the rep was unable to get the airline to answer. The United rep told us he would call us back in 1 hour with an update on our luggage. We of course waited and the call back never came. On the 72hr of still not having luggage and not a single update from either airline or the claim center, we called United once again. This time the rep was able to tell us that our bags never made it on our connecting flight from Newark to Munich and our bags where still in the United States and we scheduled on a flight to Germany and would make it to Naples Italy at 10:30 that night. The next morning we called United to make sure our luggage did make it to Italy and the rep told us we had no baggage claim submitted and we needed to file one at the airport in Italy and again we needed to call Lufthansa. After 4 days with no luggage, half of our trip, we called our chauffeur that picked us up in Italy to drive us to our villa. We asked if he had any idea how we could get in contact with anyone at the Naples airport to find out if our bags made it or were even in route. He had a driver that was picking up at the airport go to the claim and ask about our missing luggage. He was able to verify that our bags did finally arrive at the airport and a rep would be bringing them to our villa that day. At the end of day 4, we finally received our missing luggage. We understand flights get delayed and bags get lost. All we wanted was answers from United and they were unable to provide that, blaming other airlines, and providing terrible customer service. When we made it back to the United States after our trip, we tried to get in contact with the customer service department to give them the opportunity to make it right.

None of this is advertised before you buy the ticket. That is just the most egregious of the problems United puts on its customers. Every other aspect of the airline's service makes it the absolute worst of the major airlines.

United,unknown,,Apr-19,1,2," |  I had a flight on United that went, not right, then down hill from there. It should have been a nice easy flight. Direct from Omaha to Newark. We ran into weather and had to land in Baltimore to refuel. Not a big deal, but they unloaded us while they refueled and waited for weather to clear. The loaded us back onto the plane, took us out on the tarmak and we had to sit for another half hour. Again, not a big deal, then the pilot announces that he has run out of flight time for the day. So, back to the Baltimore terminal where they had us get off the plane and told us to go down to baggage claim because everything upstairs was closed. We were told that they were getting us a bus to take us from Baltimore to Newark, but guess what, no bus driver. They couldn't get one. On top of that, no hotel rooms in the area. So, guess what, we, the entire set of passengers, were left in Baltimore airport overnight. No food, no water, no blankets, nothing, just a you can go back upstairs when the TSA comes in in the morning. I get it, sometimes things go wrong with air travel. Sometimes there are delays. But, as a passenger, being abandoned by the carrier at the airport baggage claim? This was supposed to be a quick 4 day trip to the city. But, no, the flight went wrong, hotel night missed, car rental canceled, entire day wasted because of this. But wait, it gets better from there. I tried reaching out to united customer service about doing something to ""make it right"". Guess what, they decided that for having done that to me, having destroyed multiple other arrangements that I had in place, for tripling the cost of my car rental, and abandoning me in an unscheduled city, they were going to offer me all of a $75 flight travel voucher so they could do it to me again.

I know delays happen and sometimes there is little that can be done, but I had just had my wallet stolen the night before, had no money or ID, and really needed to get home. Because of the long delay, I was going to have to sleep in the airport that night, and then sleep in the Chicago airport the next night, with no money for food (wallet stolen). I felt the first agents at the desk were at least trying to be helpful after I explained my situation, but due to the long line they had to leave before I could find an earlier flight. Before leaving, they requested to have a supervisor come to the desk to see if there were any exceptions that could be made. The next agent I worked with was God awful and extremely insensitive. After again explaining my situation, I told her the previous agent was trying to help me find an earlier flight, either via united or another airline, to no avail. She said that agent should have never looked for another flight because they were not supposed to change anything, no exceptions. We spoke a little more, but she was of little help, and even had the audacity to joke around at my situation. It was infuriating. Eventually a supervisor showed up, but when I explained to him what was going on he asked the agent if they looked at any other airlines to see if there was anything that can be done, to which she replied she checked, but there was nothing available. This was right after she told me she wouldn't look because she couldn't change anything if she wanted to.... I eventually had to sleep in the airport until the flight later on in the day(which was delayed 1 more time). Luckily I found a flight that night from Chicago to Cincinnati via another airline so I didn't have to sleep in another airport overnight again, but I was severely underwhelmed with the help I received from United. I didn't understand why my flight was delayed for so long when I was able to find a flight so quickly with another airline.

Forced me to check my bag again today, even after an hour plus phone call prior to arriving at the airport, where I tried everything I could to get them to allow me to not have to check my carry on. Apparently it’s cheaper to pay a service charge, in addition to paying for a checked bag, than to upgrade my ticket for another $100.

Connecting through Copenhagen was not possible, but she did manage to force open a business class seat on United's non-stop IAD-PEK. In fact, both flights were eminently pleasant, although 13 hours on any flight seems interminable. Both flights departed and arrived significantly early, and service onboard met my expectations for a long haul business class flight. Although our cabin was 100% full, the attendants hustled and provided attentive service. The elaborate meal on the flight to China was delicious and filling, although the beef main-course could have been somewhat hotter. In addition, United's 2x2x2 seating on the 787 is not the equal of the 1x2x1 arrangement I was anticipating on SAS. Nevertheless, the seat was quite comfortable. Special mention should be made of the bedding United offers in Polaris. In the end, although I was disappointed to miss out on flying with SAS and Air China, this was my first experience with the new Polaris business class, and I was impressed by crew, plane, and customer service.",5,9,yes,7th May 2019,"""2x2x2 seating on the 787""", (United States) ,Tampa to Beijing via Washington,5,Business Class,5,Solo Leisure,5,1,0

Travel with your organization is truly frustrating. Your flights are never on time, you charge ridiculous prices for services that are either free or half the cost with your competitors. Even your own employees seem frustrated working for your organization. I am writing this review to let less experienced travelers know. If you have other flight options, please use them. United will be routinely late, you will miss connections and they will nickel and dime you for everything.

United,,,May-19,1,1," | I don't even know where to begin. I flew from London to Chicago with a transit in Brussels. First of all, my connecting flight was overbooked so they made me wait for a very long time before finally letting me and many others waiting know that we will have a seat on the plane. They also forced me to check in my hand luggage which contained critical documents that I needed because the flight was overbooked. The worst is yet to come. I waited for an hour in Chicago for my luggage but it never came. I went to the United counter and they told me it never left London and they told me that they will put my luggage on the next flight but guess what, it's been 24 hours and I've been on the phone with them twice and nobody can locate my luggage. Not a single person. I flew to Chicago to attend my sister's graduation so now I'm stranded with no toiletries, no clothes and all they can say is for me to keep my receipts. I am also sure that I'll be getting reimbursed 2 months later. United is the worst airline with no manners at all. Do not start their Mileage Program because they don't even have great benefits.

United,,,Apr-19,0,0," |  Anchorage to Rio de Janeiro via Chicago / Panama. I bought a ticket flight with United a long time ago and I choose United because of the short duration of the flight and short layover between the flights. Less than 1 month to the trip I received an email with a flight change using Copa Airlines flights. It was added another connection increasing my overall flight trip for more than 6 hours. The trip hours doesn’t make sense: I would arrive in Chicago at 11 am but my next flight time would be at 9 am from Chicago to Panama, which means I would arrive in Chicago 2 hours late for the next flight. (they sent it to me - company huge mistake with time sense) I called to customer service to try to fix it and they offered another ticket with 16hours of a layover or the reimbursement of the ticket! How I would find another international ticket in so short notice with a good price and good conditions of time flight? I asked to talk with the manager that was not flexible at all and said that I must accept the conditions of the changes otherwise the only thing they can do it is reimbursement. However, that was not a simple change condition... that was a huge mistake with time flight. I couldn’t get a plane that had already left because I flight that they added. I would miss the connection because of a United airline mistake. The manager was not doing anything to try to fix my problem and she said that: “ in my end, there is no more I can do”. I had to accept their change offer conditions resulting in a more 7 hours of increase in my overall flight trip. By the end of the call, the manager was impolite on her manners with an angry tone of voice.

It wasn’t until we got on the tarmac and the plane was still sitting. Apparently the captain had to some systems checks and something didn’t pass. Once passed about an hr had lapsed fuel has been burned so we had to return to the gate to refuel. It took a total of 2 hrs for the process and we had a connecting flight to Italy and only had a two hour layover. All the while the flight attendants could not reassure that our connecting flight would be held for us to catch. There were issues with this situation from the get go. The thought of a cancelled flight was something I understand is normal but at the 11th hr was not appropriate notification to customers. For customer safety, one would think that the pilot both the ones on the previous flight and current flight should have some system of checks for the plane well before we get on the plane for the aforementioned safety and efficiency. All this added stress to customers could have been avoided if there was a better system of checks and communications going out to customers.

United,,,Apr-19,2,2," |  El Paso to Houston. Truly a poor airline service all around. The plane from the small airport to Houston smelled filthy and had tiny seats, even for a petite female. I opted for the cheapest option for my flight - basic economy, which was a huge mistake. They did not authorize changes, cancellations, or adjustments at any time immediately after purchase. After waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I was greeted by a customer service representative who basically just told me there’s nothing they could do and maybe try contacting my ticket issuer, Capitol One. I had applied some reward points to deduct about $93 from my over $400 round trip ticket from Killeen TX to El Paso TX. I contacted them only to be told that United is the only company authorized to make changes to my flight itinerary, which I can only imagine the original United rep has already known (or should have at least). Essentially she had just pointed fingers elsewhere to avoid problem solving. We are also not even allowed a carry on item at this rate, which seems completely unreasonable. The price of their economy tickets are not comparable to other airlines such as Frontier or Southwest, which makes it more confusing as to why they are so strict (the fact that I regularly use cheap airlines should indicate that my standards are not high to begin with, I just like affordable travel). On the same token, even if I had paid a higher fare to be able to carry on items and adjust my flight, I still would be sitting in the same dingy aircraft crammed next to the person in the seat next to me. I would almost be insulted that I bothered to pay the $50-100 more for the same poorly maintained vehicle. The aisles in my first flight were so narrow that I was shoulder checked every time someone walked by, while still shoulder to shoulder with the gentleman next to me. The seat did not recline either, so I sat there, sitting up at 90 degrees, being bumped for an hour from both sides. Furthermore, their WiFi is both overpriced and limiting. To be fair, I should have read more carefully where it states “steaming not supported”. I could not watch Hulu or Netflix with the $9.99 for 1 hour of WiFi that I paid for. Instead I’m using it to write this review, while on my return flight that was delayed for 2 hours this morning. Instead of watching the new Game of Thrones episode on the WiFi that could have paid for a meal, I will be sitting here with my elbows and knees completely tucked in uncomfortably, again, as to not be sitting on top of the man next to me.

We got to the airport at about 9pm, made it to the gate to see that our flight had been delayed until 8am the next day. It was because one person called in sick. The airline did not get us a hotel for the night, so we slept at the airport on the incredibly uncomfortable couches because the tile floor, which would have been more comfortable, was too cold and we weren't even allowed through security to the gate so we were in front of the doors that were opening and closing, with loud announcements coming in every minute or so. United airlines gave each of us three $10 meal vouchers in compensation that were ultimately useless as we did not have a long enough layover in Chicago to buy anything.

Not the nicest situation but I was okay with that. However, going back was a complete mess. There was a gigantic winter storm occurring in Minnesota, which was where my return flight was scheduled to go to. I assumed that there would be delays, which there were, but they didn’t inform us of this until after our flight was scheduled so I spent all day at the airport just waiting for my flight to get delayed. At this point they rescheduled it for the next morning, which was dumb because the storm was more than likely not going to be done until 1pm the next day, but because it wasn’t large enough of a delay they weren’t going to supply us with hotel rooms or discounts of any sort. Instead, they offered us cots to sleep on in a hallway of the airport. I, being a broke recently graduated college student, took them up on this offer and I really wish I hadn’t... the cots were stained all over and I guess they couldn’t shut the lights off in the hallway or the loud announcements that shout things like “no smoking in the airport” because those are all very necessary to hear at 2am... so as you can imagine I slept horrible waking up every 20 minutes to one of their announcements. It also didn’t help that the staff wouldn’t stop talking. They didn’t care at all that there were people trying to rest. I wouldn’t have cared if they spoke quietly or shut doors to the rooms they were in, but they were practically yelling while socializing. And to top everything off I was awoken to a lovely “4am wake up call.” That’s literally what they yelled at us as they walked down the hallway and they didn’t even give me a minute to get off my cot until they were standing over me waiting to fold my cot up. So I got up, left, and an hour later at 5am I received a text that my flight was delayed till 1pm. Yep. I slept on a cot for nothing and I now have 8 hours to kill and all I really want is a shower and a bed. Oh and they’ve changed my gate 6 times.

So, they basically say you can fly the next day and offer no form of real compensation for the inconvenience (they never do and will fight tooth and nail not to except perhaps in the form of a voucher for another flight with them). This resulted in wasted money and time on Lyfts to and from the airport and an unnecessary delay in the trip. The smug expression on the lady at the airport's face said everything about how little she cared about the inconvenience this had on a customer. Thanks a lot, United.

Get to the airport and I proceed to get three more texts just adding more and more delay time. We end up sitting in the tiny Cozumel airport for 5 hours. Finally get on the plane and the flight attendant is condescending and rude. I asked for headphones and she said “no..I’ve already been up and down this aisle asking 3 times”. That’s untrue, she asked 1 time and I said no because I didn’t realize I’d be able to watch the movie, I thought I would have to pay extra to watch. When I realized I was going to be able to watch, that’s when I asked for headphones. I did it politely and still she spoke to me as though I was a child. We get to Houston and the plane stopped, people thought we were at the gate and proceeded to stand (many people were desperately trying to catch connection..us included), come to find out we were not actually at gate (there wasn’t one available because we were so late) flight attendant comes on speaker and begins to berate those standing up. I get it, it’s a safety issue but a courteous please sit back down, we’re not at a gate would have sufficed. Again, she was condescending, spoke to all of us as if we were idiots. So we ended up sitting on the runway for 20-30 minutes or so and we did indeed miss our connecting flight. We went to customer service (we had already asked to be put on standby for the last flight of the night for OKC) just to be told the later flight was overbooked and we had a slim chance of getting on..my husband had looked on the app and it showed they had three open seats. Told by customer service something along the lines of “those are seats blocked off by travel agents for potential customers”? And to make matters worse, that all flights were full until 9:30 pm the next night! Putting us in Houston for over 24 hours. So apparently customers who have already paid aren’t as important and customers who might possibly book in the future? Makes no sense! I tried to tell them we needed to get home as we have jobs and kids and I was completely out of blood pressure medication. At that point I just wanted to rent a car and drive the 8 hours home. Asked about reimbursement for having to rent a car, it was a no-go. So we crossed our fingers and went to wait and see if we got on on standby (oh I failed to mention, this flight was delayed as well). We got the last two standby seats thank god, however the plane was very old, very uncomfortable and something kept banging under my feet. Needless to say I’m glad it was just an hour home. I’ve never been so glad to have my feet on the ground. I will be using another airline from now on and will suggest all my friends and family do the same. I understand sometimes delays are inevitable (this wasn’t weather related, we were never told what was going on) but the lack of customer service after the fact and the rudeness of the flight attendants is enough to turn me completely off of United.",1,1,,27th March 2019,"""This airline is horrible""", (United States) ,Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston,1,Premium Economy,1,Couple Leisure,1,1,0

United,,,Mar-19,4,1," |  Worst experience ever! 9 hour flight and offered two glasses of water and one ounce of pretzels. For $1400 you would think that in nine hours you would get a meal. But the bigger problem was the return flight from Maui to Chicago on United flight 348. The flight got canceled due to mechanical problems. No hydraulics, I get that, you cannot fly then. But these things happen and there should be protocol in place. 300 + people stood in lines for hours trying to find their luggage, trying to book a new flight or trying to get vouchers. After 90 minutes in line 3, the voucher line, she finally starts handing them out, only to run out of vouchers after three passengers. The luggage line after 2 hours hadn’t moved hardly any people. Three reps from United had absolutely no clue what to do. People who had to stay overnight and needed to retrieve their luggage were sent on a wild goose chase all over the airport. Three hours after the flight was supposed to have left, the agents at the check in gates, overwhelmed and utterly confused, finally started, with three baggage claim checks at a time, disappeared for 15-30 minutes at a time to retrieve 3 bags. It took forever. It was so poorly handled! These mechanical failures can happen but these people should have been kind, apologetic, professional and above all helpful. They were not. A bad situation became out of control and every guest left (some are still there!) frustrated.

You can not check In online under basic economy unless you check luggage for $30 each flight. This policy makes for long lines at the ticketing counter due to those who use to not check bags as a time saver. The long lines at the ticketing counter makes it so United does not have enough manpower to check in customers that use to bypass the line causing new added congestion.

Working with Expedia and United, I was able to have my flight changed to Aspen. Unfortunately, my flight was cancelled another 4 times because of weather. Finally, all airports were shut down for the rest of the day. I was notified about each cancellation. I started out making changes on the app. But, once the airports were closed, it became too complicated to do that way and I needed to speak to an agent. I spoke with someone, on the phone, who was very emphatic to me and did whatever she could to help me. Since I was so close to the Aspen airport, I decided to go in and speak with an agent in person to make the changes. The man I spoke with was so helpful. I was switching from date to date, around to different airports, and went thru a lot of times. He had no problem spending as much time with me as I needed. He was also able to accommodate whenever I needed to change it to. This was a frustrating and exhausting 12 hours that was made much easier by everyone that I dealt with.

They have terrible inflight entertainment because they expect you to pay $10.99 for barely any workable internet connection and require you download a plug in to enjoy movies/tv but make it absolutely impossible to find. So then you're stuck with no entertainment options at an unfair rate. To put in perspective, that's more expensive than my monthly Netflix fee. In addition, unlike other generous airlines, they require you pay for absolutely everything. You might think you are getting a bargain flight, but when checking out, you are required to pay extra if you want to sit with your family, extra if you want a carry-on rather than offering it complimentary, and they charge you for everything else offered on the plane. Surprised they don't have someone waiting outside the door demanding money for toilet paper. Bottom line, it is worth paying a bit more upfront to fly with a different airline than being surprised halfway through your trip when the expenses add up and you're feeling more and more agitated by the second.

United,,,Mar-19,0,0," |  Tampa to Calgary via Denver. Recently; my 3 boys, and I, plus our 2 dogs flew with United. The flight we booked was to travel home to Alberta after missing the ticketing timeline with westjet at baggage & ticket kiosk by less than 15 minutes, they refused to check our bags assuming we couldnt possibly get through security in time. As such we were not issued our boarding passes. So we took the cheapest flight I could find for the next day, with United. (Which was surprisingly reasonable.) There was issue when we first flew out of Tampa, and had to land in Houston and change plains. Once in Houston we were delayed maybe 2 hours, due to weather and we weren't the only travelers being detained because of the winter weather happening in Denver. When we finally arrived in Denver, we had missed our connecting flight and it kinda just gets longer from there due to so many travelers in similar situations. It wasnt pleasant nor was it really avoidable, and despite the several hundreds of people rerouted or detained - I can't thank United for their empathetic response throughout the venture and their commitment to customer service. From the booking and getting my dogs their boarding pass, to rescheduling both in person the first time, to calling and requesting a second choice to have us home a little sooner over the phone, United was cordial and apologetic and more than accommodating. It was an inconvenient couple of days and some issues resulted from the rebooking confusion that were human error, but put right with as much haste as they could. I had insurance for my original flight - and they dismissed me immediately and I tried to communicate with westjet at the time we were to travel on their flight and was rudely told, ""be on time next time."" (Which seems bs, since that plain departed 45 minutes late.) Extra thanks to Donna who dealt with following up on any grievances or issues she could help with after we arrived home. I very much appreciate everyone's extra effort on our behalf, knowing we were not the only ones in the same situation.

United,,,Mar-19,3,1," |  Cabo San Lucas to La Guardia via Houston. This is the worst airline ever. The lines were miles long at Newark just to go through TSA. We were a group of 8. Airport staff had to assist us in skipping the line just to make our flight that was boarding in ten minutes. We were literally on a 2 hour line. Our flight was empty because 80% of the passengers missed the flight. On our way back home, we left Cabo and arrived to Houston to connect to get to NYC. Once again Bs! The flight landed and we were on the tarmac for a while waiting for space. People were telling the flight attendants to make a announcement to let the people that have connecting flights off first. They made the announcement last minute, and it didn’t help because once again everyone missed their flights. There was a long line to get a receipt for customs. Then we had to get our bags and recheck them. Houston’s airport needs a AirTran because we ran for miles just to reach our gate. Of course the flight left everyone behind. There’s was only one flight leaving back to Newark. Only two people from my party of 8 was able to fly standby. 80 percent of our flight had to stay the night in Houston. I’ve never seen anything like this before. I would rather fly with Spirit or Southwest! You get to the airport hours before and still miss your flight. I have no idea why they would book connecting flight that they know,  there’s no way possible you can make the connecting flight.

United,,,Feb-19,4,4," |  Houston to New York. Thank you to the kindness of United Airlines employees. On February 13 at 2pm the woman (who was on the VIP line), helped me with respect and kindness and the whole staff at United was great. I was on my 3 month MD Anderson Cancer Center treatment trip. I always fly in on a Tues and leave the next day (Wed) for medical treatments. There is a lot of stress involved with this quarterly trip and I will not go into that. In any event, I was in my Uber on my way back from MD Anderson to the airport and I had to call United because I was having an error checking in online. I actually was taking the trip to NYC instead of Rochester because the flights were to high and because of my medical situation, I am limited financially and need to be very frugal about my trips for my treatments. So I decided it would be cheaper to fly into NYC, vist the night with a friend and take the train the next day! In my call to United from my Uber, we realized that I had booked the trip back home on March 13th instead of Feb 13th. I had never noticed the error. The United employee on the phone said she could book me for a later flight that day but it would be $700 additional dollars on top of my flight. (I purchased the flight insurance because of fear of problems but since the error was on my end, I'm sure I wouldn't have been helped by the insurance.) In any event, I told her I would just talk to someone when I got the airport but she did say they wouldn't do any better!. I was beyond stressed as with the whole medical situation and having to travel alone and the cost the quarterly trips take with hotels and travel etc. I went to talk to the United employee who was at the Airport and when I started to explain what happened, I just lost it. I went to pieces. And I am the type of person who never cries in front of anyone, let alone in a public place.I couldn't even explain what happened I was too upset. In any event, I was treated professional and so kindly at the United desk. This woman and her manger (not sure who was either) really helped me. They worked something out for me and I was able to take the same flight that I thought I was booked on and it just so happened it was somewhat delayed so the timing was perfect.

United,,,Feb-19,0,2," |  Fort Lauderdale to Washington DC. Basic Economy: Beware! Even if your bag fits under the seat, the box the airline uses to verify the size of your luggage is smaller than the area under the seat, and United will try to scam you out of $55 at the gate and force you to gate-check your bag -- even if the United attendant at the counter issues you a boarding pass, and has no problem with your bag. That is probably because they only charge $30 at the counter if you decide to check your bag then- but squeeze an additional $25 out of you for any bag they force you to check at the gate. I was stopped halfway down the breezeway, after the gate attendant had already scanned my boarding pass and told me to have a good flight. I was ready to throw away my belongings before I would allow United to scam me out $55. Fortunately, the attendant eventually let me board with my small backpack. I had already spent $17 to UPS some of my belongings home, so my luggage contained even less than when I had flown TO my destination. That was also Basic Economy on United -- and neither the counter attendant nor the gate attendant had had any issue with my backpack for that flight. I will never again fly United. Other airlines have Basic Economy -- but those rules are much less restrictive and those carriers do not treat their passengers nearly as poorly. United treats you like chattel. Also: my ticket was not even inexpensive!!! I had already paid more than I usually do for a ticket to Fort Lauderdale, which was why I had decided not to upgrade from Basic Economy or pay extra for luggage.

I had an email/text saying that they might experience delays and I called customer service for alternate options and nothing seemed to workout and so I decided to cancel the flight and go ahead with some other options available and they said they won’t refund until they cancel the flight and they gave me the worst options and made me stay at the airport for almost 12 hours transferring here and there almost 5 times delaying all my plans planned ahead,1,1,,11th February 2019,"""had many bad experiences""", (United States) ,Chicago to Kansas city,1,Economy Class,1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1

We were told that the airplane needed an oil change and that we would only be delayed 30 minutes. After missing my connecting flight I went to customer service and was told if I hurry I can make it to the flight that was still boarding to make it to my destination. Was turned away at the gate saying they didn’t make accommodations for everyone on my previous flight. When I expressed that I was directed to that gate from customer service I was told that the previous person was mistaken and I was going to have to wait until 2:45. Putting me at my final destination 5 hours behind schedule. Making me miss my ride and events planned ahead of time.

United,,,Jan-19,1,1," |  Oklahoma City to Washington. Today I had the seemingly bad luck of flying with United.  After getting to the airport I found out my flight was cancelled. Once I found out I went to the nearest United ticket counter but on the way ran into a gate agent who said ""you should have known the flight was cancelled since 1pm."" I responded sorry I was at work I didn't know.  She tells me her plane is arriving which wasn't at the gate refused to help and does a slight jog to the gate and tells me to go back through security to the ticket desk.  Once I get to ticketing outside of security the agent simply keeps repeating that ""flight is cancelled due to weather"".  She reluctantly says after me asking repeatedly what does that mean, that I have to get myself a hotel for the night. She doesn't offer me any kind of information on how or who to call. She just ask if i was from there and I said no. After I ask another agent what does this mean she hands me a pink form with number and how to get a hotel. I then go back through security and once I look at the board I see a flight that will get me out of OKC with these very unhelpful United Employees. I call customer service and they rebook me on the IAH flight so I can get out of OKC and guess whose gate it is... The gate agent who says she was so busy even though the plane had not arrived and was being very dismissive The agent on the phone checked me in and I had them on speaker phone. I explained that to her and she goes policy is we can't let you on the flight because it's too close to departure. The same lady that told me I should have known in our previous encounter says says ""you should have called earlier."" I emphatically explain how when I'm checked in already and I'm on the phone with a United Employee. He was on speakerphone ""are they not letting you board? You are checked in."" She again says no and to talk to her supervisor and points. She says it's policy but then reluctantly walks over and let's me board as if she was doing me a favor.  Apparently policy didn't matter then and I wish the ordeal stopped there. When I get on the plane all of the bins are closed so I ask where can I put my bag. As far as I am concerned it could have been checked. The flight attendant gives me a bewildered how do I know look and ask what seat I'm in. It really didnt matter when I'm one of the last people on the plane and all bins are closed.  I go to my seat and open multiple bins only for her to to walk back and open one bin that has room and wasn't by my seat.

I must say the flight back was good and that will be posted in a different review but this one was appalling. We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce.

After telling me my carry-on bag was fine, they decided it was too big, as well as many other people, and made us leave our bags outside the plane without telling us where to get them. After the ride was over I had to search for someone to ask, where they made us all line up in the cold and wait for them. They may have actually told us, but whoever gave the instructions spoke such a poor excuse for English it was pathetic, and I really don't mind accents normally, as long as I can understand. They can't do the job if nobody can understand them and they just keep yelling and gesturing and even grabbing at my belongings because they can't compose a sentence to tell me what to do with them. I was also supposed to be in a row by myself, but out of nowhere the flight crew pulls out a seat behind the wall and blocks me in the aisle and completely blocks off the bathroom so nobody could use it and making one long row with no space in it.

United,,,Jan-19,2,1," |  Madison to Newark via Chicago. This morning, I arrived at the airport and waited in line to check my bag for 25 minutes. Once I finally got up to the counter the agent at my desk disappeared for another 15 minutes. She finally came back but said I would miss my flight because I was a few minutes late from the checked baggage cutoff time. The agent tried rebooking my ticket for me. I’m not sure if she was new or wasn’t trained on the system well enough because it took her a long time to rebook the ticket to the point where her supervisor had to jump in. Her supervisor told her to push me to the side and said that they would “deal with me later”. I waited another 20 minutes for them to get through the rest of the line. Once I finally got my ticket rebooked, the flight is not only not a direct flight, it’s also supposed to reach my destination 8 hours after my initial flight. First of all, I shouldn’t have had been put on hold just because there’s a long line to get through. Secondly, right before I was pushed to the side, the agent promised to put me on the next possible flight at 11 am. But after being pushed aside, I got put on the 1:50 pm flight. The inconsistency and empty promising is so unacceptable. I am being lied to and neglected by your staff. I have never experienced this with other airlines. Delta next door had the same amount of people in line and they got through the line 30 minutes faster than United. Delta in the past had allowed me to board my airplane still while my baggage goes on the next flight but United would not allow me to do that. I have lost 8 hours of my time to spend with my parents whom I have not seen in 2 years due to the your staff’s incapability to work efficiently. How could you possibly ever replace this valuable time I lost because of your inconsiderate employees. Thanks to United, I will now have 5 hours to cry at the airport.

To add to the chaos, everybody was supposed to check-in at the kiosk and there was absolutely nobody to help in case somebody got stuck. At one point 5 out of 6 kiosks were unable to complete the check-in, stranding people behind. There was a separate queue for travel assistance, which had about 20-30 people waiting and only 1 counter  was available for assistance. It took us about 1 hour 45 min to complete the check in and reach the security. On another note, I was traveling with my boyfriend and we wanted our seats together. We had selected the seats immediately after booking our tickets. The seats got reshuffled three times due to ""a change in the plane"" and ""the system"" reshuffled the seats such that our seats got separated.

United,,,Dec-18,1,1," |  Toronto to Oaxaca via Houston. Holding customers for ransom? I recently had an unbelievable experience flying to Mexico on United with a bike. Booked the flight several months back, checked with the United call centre on charges for taking a bike and confirmed what I'd read earlier on the United web site. Both made it clear that if the bike bag fell within weight and dimensional limits it would be charged simply as a second item of checked baggage i.e. $50. When I checked in at the airport, the United agent insisted that I owed an extra $200 (!) for the bike even though it came in under 50 lb limit and was the standard dimensions set out in the Airline's limits. No amount of back and forth would bring them round to honour the original terms. And curiously my two companions who had checked in a little earlier for the same flights also with bikes were charged much less - one paid $25 as it was his first and only item of checked luggage and the other was charged nothing for his bike as second item (his was in an identical Evoc bike bag and weighed just a little more than mine). The experience left a very bad taste. What can you do but pay up when you have already bought the ticket and will be leaving soon?

Booking through United Airlines was the worse mistake I’ve ever made. Once we left SJD airport (Cabo) at 12:05 pm everything seemed normal until we got closer to (IAH) Houston we were suppose to arrive there at 4:30 pm to make it to our connecting flight at 7:45pm and we were supposed to reach our destination at 11:38 but the pilot said we had to go to San Antonio for a little bit until the storm cleared up when we landed in San Antonio to get more fuel he then told us that since he exceeded the maximum number of hours to fly for the day which was 12 hours that we had to wait for the new crew to board which will take about 45 minutes. So went through customs as instructed and got some food because they told us that we won’t be able to leave until 8:15 pm. While waiting the airline staff told us that they will have to reschedule our flight but they will put us in a hotel room once we reach Houston, TX.Then we start waited and they they boarded us on the plane around 10 pm to wait some more. Finally we take off around 10:30 pm and reach Houston around 11:30 and we spoke with a customer service representative and she said they will not give us a room because it was weather related but the pilot told us he ran out of hours to fly for the day. So then we got stuck staying in the Houston airport overnight waiting for our flight at 12:00pm. Then around 10:00 am I received notification that our plane wasn’t going to arrive until 2:06 since they had to find a plane for us. So then I spoke with another rep and she said they weren’t going to do anything for the inconvenience or even offer a food voucher. And we were stuck at the airport with nothing since our bags already made it to Baltimore. The thing that makes me even more disgusted is the fact that my cousin that flew through Southwest leaving a few minutes after us was able to get from Cabo to Houston without any delays and she made it back to BWI by 11:45 pm on 10/31 while me and my other 3 cousins made it to BWI at 5:30 pm on 11/1.

United,,,Oct-18,1,1, |  I am writing this letter furious with United Airlines for what I am being put through without my consent. Yesterday I arrived to my flight 25 minutes prior to scheduled boarding time. I  find out I could not get my bag on the flight because the cut off is 30 minutes prior to boarding. Missing the cut off by 5 minutes and with no other flights out that night I agreed upon taking the morning flight out. I arrive to the airport at 5:20. I walk right up to an agent showed them my new boarding pass and he then pointed his finger to the kiosks and told me I had to go over there. My boarding pass then does not read on the kiosk so I then have to wait for the one man working all of the kiosks In the airline while The agents continued to talk amongst themselves behind the desks. Finally the man comes to help me and then tells me I have to check in with an agent and my flight is leaving in 30 minutes to get my bag on. I walked to the desk and quickly explained that I need to get this bag on that I am going to miss my flight.  I Demanded someone to Help me and another lady told me that she could help me so I ran over to her. She put mne on the next flight without telling me and checks my bag. I am now running through TSA and  get to the gate at 6am to see the door close and I begged them to open it back up and they told me you are already put on the next flight. ,1,1,,14th October 2018,"""Missing  cut off by 5 minutes""", (United States) ,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1,Economy Class,1,Business,1,1,1

Both of my flights were canceled, the one coming home forced me to get a hotel in Houston. Trying to get questions answered, I called, emailed, left voice messages, and all I got was I can't help you try another department. I paid for the front row both direction and was given a ticket towards the back of the plane. Even with the confirmation email in hand I had problems getting the seat I requested and paid for (they were empty). The planes had no entertainment, no radio, nothing, I would have been fine with this if the ticket wasn't $500, but more in line of $200. Both flights were morning flights and the served cookies as the snack, really who wants cookies at 8 am. The flight crew came by once to hand out the cookies and a tiny drink just enough to get your mouth wet craving more and once to collect trash at the very end of the flight. After countless attempts to get answers and solve my issues I had to threaten a credit card dispute to get a response. What did the offer? A worthless voucher that would have cost me more money if I could have even used it.",1,1,,13th October 2018,"""Both of my flights were canceled""", (United States) ,Tucson to Houston,1,Economy Class,1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1
United,Boeing 777-200,,Oct-18,4,4," |  Beijing to Chicago. Overall pretty good though United Airlines has a problem with lack of professionalism displayed by their FA's. The food and IFE were pretty good. The 2-4-2 cabin configuration was a bit cramped but not too bad. Seat comfort was ok though storage space was limited. This was a Polaris class flight BTW. We got off to a bad start before taking off when of all people the lead FA grabbed my wife purse to store it without saying a word. When my wife said she needed meds for her purse the FA turned this into power trip asserting her authority. I spoke with her before take off and told her we did not appreciate her approach. After all its not her purse and a simple explanation would have been in order vs. turning this into an argument. I also reminded her we had spend ""a lot of money"" for these Polaris biz seats and expected proper courtesy. To her credit she apologized and was most attentive during the rest of the flight. However I heard two other FA's gossiping about passengers with backpacks in a demeaning way. Unfortunately the FA's as a whole have a long way to go on terms of professional behavior. They could learn this valuable lesson from star alliance parties like ANA, Asiana and Thai whose FA's show true value towards the passengers.",3,6,,4th October 2018,"""lack of professionalism""", (United States) ,Beijing to Chicago,4,Business Class,2,Couple Leisure,4,1,0

We were not even the last group to board and they forced everyone to check the rest of their carry on luggage without letting any of us use the space under the seats in front of us to store necessities. I only had one carry on item as did my husband and was not permitted to attempt to fit it on the plane. When we got on the plane it was probably over 100 degrees and miserable. I saw plenty of room under the seat in front of me for my bag. I was reduced to carrying around my necessary medications and items in a trash bag so I wouldn’t lose anything. Very disappointed with this experience. Step it up United. I think incentive should have been offered from the beginning to those willing to check bags in order to not have this issue if it is known that your plane cannot accommodate the permitted carry on items or that people should be required to only store one item in overhead and one under the seat.

We were then delayed 2 hours because the WiFi didn’t work. We had to sit on the plane whilst this was being fixed. Then we got onto the runway and a passenger in the seat behind me noticed a panel on the left wing was flapping, the air hostess said she’d check it out with the captain and then she came back and said ‘this isn’t right, the captain has said he needs to check it out’ - we were on the runway how did this not flag up before! This fault then left us delayed 1 hour, then 2, then 3 all the way through until 1.40am in the morning. I was offered a full refund - to which I wanted to take - but I was told that there was no way my checked bag would be leaving the aircraft so it’d be flying to Honolulu without me. This was the start of my travels so that bag had all my possessions in, including my medication! I was told I would not be able to retrieve my medication or bag! I explained to them that I wanted the refund as the delays were beyond a joke, to the extent that one of the managers from United airlines said ‘this has never happened to United airlines’. In the end we took off at 2am, I felt very forced to stay on the flight and I was told I would be compensated. The customer care team offered me a measly $150 e-ticket for another united airline flight - i explained how I am from England so I wouldn’t be able to use it. And in any case $150 wouldn’t get me far! I asked for the cash refund that I was originally offered hoping that someone in the customer care team would understand my frustration - but no they didn’t care at all. The e-ticket offered is laughable - my flight cost £270 which equates to about $350 so this $150 offered is a joke.

My wife has been told for the past week that another passenger retrieved her luggage from the terminal carousel and that this passenger would likely have to return her bag in order to retrieve the proper bag since it was the only one left. We were told this for nearly a week. Then today we find out that the next day from the initial missing date, that passenger sent his brother to retrieve the luggage. Best part, luggage was given with first securing my wife's bag. This guest claims his brother did not grab any other luggage. We are told this a week later when prior to today we were told that we were waiting for this guest to return the luggage. This is beyond unacceptable. We were given no update that this had occurred until a week later! Their solution: file a police report so they can ""process"" the claim and access camera footage. This is unacceptable.

Again the center console was visibly dirty. I paid almost $5000 for this? The flight attendants were unfriendly and we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience for them. Our connection was in Newark and the plane we were supposed to leave on was diverted to another airport. Flight was delayed for hours while we waited for another plane. That one was United Express and that plane was very old and the interior was not maintained.

The airlines constantly has flight delay, extremely bad or worst customer services - bad attitude of gate agent, attendants, and all known to everyone the worst food services among all the airlines I've experienced. I fly often with European and Asian airlines, even latin american airlines, all I have received much better services than from United. This is the latest experience I had just 2 days ago traveling from SFO to Reykjavik connecting at Frankfurt. Notified in the morning of departure, flight was delayed for 1 hour 15 min. I have 1 hour 35min connection at Frankfurt originally. Got to airport, the check-in agent said the flight should take off per new time and will arrive only 30min than original. It turned out flight was late departure for 2 hour 15min, and arrived 1 hour 10 min later than planned. And got text message at FRA saying they put me on the flight next day midnight arrival to Iceland. That is 1 and half day later. I only going to be at Iceland for 3 days. Then to make things worse, they couldn't get my baggage transfer to the new flight that I had switched to at FRA airport. Now I'm stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can't get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said ""open to the photo page"". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United's attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn't send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do. They made many phone calls while asking me to wait and took care of everything and handed over my new boarding pass and told me they've notified baggage handling of my new flights.",1,1,,2nd September 2018,"""Worst airline in the world""", (United States) ,San Francisco to Frankfurt,3,Economy Class,2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2

Every personal detail I entered and gave them such as passport no. DOB, Expiration date and ticket details all matched, but they still didn't let me go through. I'm baffled and wondering as to why didn't United rectified my ticket when I have given them my passport details and all. They took me to the TSA and adding salt to my injury, they kept me waiting for an hour, took me back to United Airlines and asked me to verify her details which the customer service on the phone did, but the United Airlines rep on the desk at the airport refused to verify it.

United,,,Aug-18,1,0," |  I was traveling with my family to London and was all set to comeback on Aug 9th. Out of the blue I got a text 3h before flight departure that my flight from LHR to EWR was canceled due to weather.  The weather could not have been more picure perfect in London and same was the case in EWR. Upon probing the customer care, they admitted that it was mechanical failure. The reason they say weather is that then they are off the hook. They could only find flight to fly the following day. Now I went from direct flight to connection through Frankfurt. I had to spend one additional day in hotel, food, clothing all purchased at my cost. Unfortunately, my flight next day was also delayed. The guys in Lufthansa said that my connection in Frankfurt was fine. I missed the connection. Now I contacted United. They said it was not their issue anymore and I have to deal with Lufthansa. Lufthansa put me now through Denmark. Fine print: My flight from Denmark to EWR was standby and Lufthansa said that it was confirmed. We go to Copenhagen to find this hard truth. Called United and as expected they passed the buck to Lufthansa who passed the buck to SAS and who in turned passed it to United. With great difficulty my family and I made it back to USA, The SAS flight was horrible. Old plane, poor service, charge for even a soda. Horrible! I came back and filed a complaint with United. They make their feedback site so restrictive that you cannot explain details or upload bills properly. They dont even have a contact number to follow up. When I didnt hear back from United and called Mileageplus service, they basically said that wait your turn and we will call you when we get to it. What arrogance and callousness.

I had a reservation for 5.40 pm flight to Atlanta on Aug 17 that was delayed by 3 hours - reason given was “late inbound crew “.After 3 hours of waiting, the flight was announced cancelled now the reason given was bad weather. The weather was fantastic here and in Atlanta from 5pm -9pm. So I don’t get it. I was going for an important medical two day training course which was starting Aug 18 at 8am to 5.30 pm . So I had to get there in time. They were able to pt me on the next flight which was supposed to depart at 9.36pm but after waiting on plane for 3 hours that was announced as cancelled too due to the thunderstorm. Funny part is we waited on flight for close to 4 hours and the storm now had passed but they could not fly as crew had timed out! I luckily hD no checked in baggage but the folks who did were asked to come back next day at 6 am to pick it up. They were not ready to give out baggage to passengers for whom flying the next day was not an option... again because their crew had gone home. It almost felt like their crew had to rush home once the clock struck a certain hour otherwise they would turn into pumpkins like in the Cinderella story! Then one of their crew members has the audacity to talk to all the stranded passengers badly - He tells us , ""this happens.  Crew has gone home, we are humans not machines, we need to go home too!

I have never lost a bag or had a bag put on the wrong flight until I flew this airline. Not only do they over charge for checked bags they mishandle them and treat you like it’s not their fault. I’ve always been weary of this airline because of their tendency to have their name in the news for negative reasons. This flight has been a prime example of why I will avoid United Airlines for the rest of my life. From Punta Cana to ORD there was hardly any service and they took thirty minutes to get us off the plane. We had a two hour layover in ORD which should have given us plenty of time to get our bags, go through customs, recheck our bag, go through security, and get something to eat before our next flight; of course with United that wasn’t the case. They took 30 minutes to get us off the plane (again), they took twice that to get our bags off of the flight, and they finally lost one of our bags and put it on another flight. Let’s just hope that the baggage check attendant (the only positive part and person from this terrible experience) is correct in saying it will be delivered by today or tomorrow.",1,1,,20th August 2018,"""worst flight experience""", (United States) ,Chicago to Cleveland,1,Economy Class,1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1

At the gate they announced that a different flight (to San Fran) was delayed 3.5 hours because they had to fly in a part for the plane from Portland. 15 minutes later they come up with a solution, the airline chose to take the plane from my flight and use it for the San Fran rout instead. Now my wife and I get to wait an extra 3.5 hours instead! My wife has to go back out of security to talk to someone from the airline, who tells her no there aren't any more flights and no we won't be compensated for the inconvenience of missing the party we are flying to LA for.

The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem ""Only effecting Skywest flights"" and that the plane couldn't, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn't do anything, but don't worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to ""Time Out:"" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that ""The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork."" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that ""If You are going to get off Plane do so Now."" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, ""It should be about 20 minutes"". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane.

We were waiting for the whole night since it had very important item in it but with no avail. Finally we contacted the agents but they did not have any communication with their drivers to tell us the ETA. On our earlier flight from SFO to LAX they lost 9 out of 10 luggage. We received those luggages three days later at our vacation destination. We had to endure those three important vacation days without required medication and daily requirement needs in our vacation.

Our flight experience yesterday was pretty bad, and after dealing with the customer service today, I feel the need to write this. First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.  No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.  It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. It’s not the poor man’s fault, sometimes it’s just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of United’s control happening, and today finally made me realize it’s just terrible customer service.  I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.  No desire to travel on this airline again. I’m flustered so I’m sure there are typos. Great trip where I got engaged and ended on a bad note.

United,Boeing 737-900,,Jul-18,0,0," | United must be trying to coerce Basic Economy buyers to upgrade by treating you like complete garbage. One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we've had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn't work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads ""Economy"", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk ""Basic Economy"" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says ""it goes over there"". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), ""License and boarding pass!"" No ""hello"", no ""how are you"", not even a complete sentence, and they weren't even very busy so it surely couldn't have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United's fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers.

They instead gave us seats close to each other. Okay fine... BUT when arriving to the airport we go to print our boarding passes and again discover that we DO NOT have seats! So we have been told on the phone to settle things at the Toronto airport, then we were told to settle things at the Newark airport, and finally we were told that they can’t do anything. Why did we spend about $250USD just to get shuffled around? Stop charging people for services that you are not providing. That is a scam, plain and simple.

The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open.

Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay  $25. When got to gate the same agent gave everyone in boarding area baggage tags to check them for free on the jetway! Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane? Overall, flying pinched inside a tiny seat with little leg room was awful. the plane was 57 degrees on return flight and stewardess said they were working on -  did finally begin to warm after 2 hours, just before landing. Did not partake of the free drinks and pretzels, so can't speak to snacks, seem crazy in short legs of flight. Would not look forward to flying again and booking online.

After removing it he said I was 1lb over and I said that 23 kilos is 51 lbs. He didn't care. Then insisted I pay $25 to check a suitcase even though was making an international connexion to one of their partners, but the swarthy 20-year old doesn't know what qualifies as a connexion. I couldn't convince him or his supervisor and they refused to call a ticketing expert. I was firm and insistent but because this supervisor told me I was rude (limited vocabulary), I paid the fine.

The problem occurred when was flying from ORD to NYC LaGuardia LGA flight was supposed to leave at 5pm suddenly flight got cancelled without further information except due to weather conditions. The 4pm flight is going ahead and the 6pm flight as well. To my surprise the 3pm, 5pm and 7pm flights are cancelled to NYC however the 4pm, 6pm and 8pm flights are normal operation. Then the chaos started tried to rebook myself on a standby for the 6pm flight didn’t work out checked with the United staff and they are probably deaf or not listening or helping not knowing where my luggage are or how to locate them or where to go. No one from the ground staff is helping and all they say it’s due to weather we can’t help you and there’s no further flights to NYC till tomorrow afternoon while I have to attend an important meeting at 8:30AM. This situation was just a joke. Eventually located my luggage which already been sent to LGA on the 6pm flight which I don’t understand how would they send luggage without the passenger being on board the flight and had to queue with my colleague for almost 2 hours to rebook ourselves. When we reached the counter the only option the clerk gave us was to rebook to Hartford which is 2 hrs away from NYC we had to accept that and sort ourselves from Hartford then that particular flight got delayed which makes it arrive in Hartford at 3am which impossible for us to find our way to NYC. Eventually we booked ourselves on a different airline and paid 500 USD each for a one way ticket from Chicago to New York City. Seriously the most unorganised airline in the world. Later on we discovered that they had a system failure and that’s why they couldn’t operate certain flights but to avoid compensating passengers or booking hotels for them they delcraed it’s due to weather.

We arrived at the Tucson airport about an hour and a half early and while we were heading to our gate we received a push notification that the flight was delayed so we went and grabbed food, and set up at a charging station a few gates down. When it was getting close to the time that we would need to start boarding, we walked over to the gate and found out that the flight left at its scheduled time. No updates, no announcement for boarding, nothing. The woman at the gate laughed it off saying that when the pilot wants to leave the pilot leaves. With no more flights leaving from Tucson that day on United, we were infuriated. The woman was not empathetic, wouldn’t look us in the eyes, and gave us no other options but to stay in Tucson (not comped by United, mind you) and arrive to Cleveland at 3pm the next day. We called the customer service line and the representative literally said “I don’t understand why you weren’t at your gate, you should have been there”. After he also unempathetically didn’t even try to help us, I asked to speak to a manager. I’m pretty sure I spoke to the same guy who just changed his voice into a higher pitched tone. He said the same and wouldn’t even give me a refund, gave me a hard time about missing the flight and said that he knows that they make courtesy announcements before taking off. Apparently you don’t, or I wouldn’t have been stranded in Tucson. After finally calling again and speaking to a much nicer woman, we were able to get a partial refund and bought tickets on American Airlines flying just a few hours later.

I was sent back and forth across the airport to talk to different people and every worker I encountered was horrendously rude and inconsiderate to my situation. My original flight had been cancelled and I was informed that I may not be able to catch another flight for three days and that they would not be providing a hotel. I retrieved a ride and made it to my destination (13 hours later than I was supposed to be there) and proceeded to follow up with phone calls to ask where my baggage might be since the workers at the airport did not answer any of my questions. The people I spoke with on the phone were just as rude and inconsiderate as the other United Airlines workers I had previously spoke with. I will not be flying with them again.

United,Boeing 777-200,,Jul-17,1,3," | An incredibly disappointing experience on United. Traveling to the Bay Area for a conference, I booked this flight on a 777-200, thinking it might be kind of fun to fly on a domestic widebody and that the cramped 3-4-3 configuration would be fine. How wrong I was. There was a half-hour delay prior to departure — annoying, but not a big deal. Once on board, however, I noticed that the TVs had been removed and replaced with personal device entertainment holders. However, we were informed that the Wi-Fi did not work and, as such, we wouldn't be able to use the Personal Device Entertainment. A six hour flight with no TVs or Wi-Fi. Unbelievable. Throughout my whole experience, the crew was incredibly rude and inattentive. Upon landing at SFO, we waited on the taxiway for 50+ minutes since (as the captain told it) United operations had screwed up and didn't have a gate for us. There were a number of passengers connecting on to other destinations, many of which there is only one flight a day to from SFO. All told, we arrived at the gate around 1.5 hours late. Combined with our delay leaving BOS, many of my fellow passengers missed their connections and had to be put up overnight. My experience on the return flight was slightly better — the Wi-Fi/personal device entertainment worked and the crew was more courteous — but the damage had been done. If I have any choice, I'll never fly with United Airlines again.",2,2,,12th June 2018,"""An incredibly disappointing experience""", (United States) ,Boston to San Francisco,1,Economy Class,2,Business,2,1,1

United,Boeing 787,,May-18,1,1," |  San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. I've had mixed feelings about this airline. I was careless enough that the ANA ticket that I purchased was actually operated by United Airlines. The horrifying experience with them starts from customer service. I telephoned them obtaining inquiries on how a less than 24 hour transit would handle baggage. I was informed that the baggage will transfer directly to my connecting flight (which was finally, and thank heavens, ANA from Haneda to Manila). The reservation agent said that connecting within 24 hour transit will not result the baggage to be claimed in HND and will be directly handled in MNL. Fine. We checked in Day of our flight with our luggage weighing less than 50 lbs, 5 luggage due to my star alliance gold status, along with my brother's normal traveler status. We were informed that the luggage will be offloaded in Haneda. This is a conflicting to the information I was provided few hours ago. The check in agent said ""You can just re-check in to your next flght"" I asked her, ""are you sure"", she was proud to answer ""NO"". Why suggest with utmost certainty to do such thing without verifying your sources. I had asked for supervisor and I was replied with ""We do not have a supervisor, he is busy!"" I am at my point of my fumes reaching to the airport's ceiling on the way how I am being handled. Finally, the supervisor at that time came and handled our baggage with manual baggage tags. The check in agent even uttered ""good luck in finding these bags"", while the supervisor gave her a blank stare. These words were also added to our fiasco Agent: There is no way I will write manual airport codes with these baggage tags, they will get lost for sure. (At least she cares about my baggage possibility of being lost). Agent: Your baggage cannot be held at the airport for security purposes. Really, security purposes? I will travel with my luggage for more than 12 hours (note it will go through a strict security check, hence, adding another 12 hours should not make any difference to impose threat to security. I am not sure why United continue to impress us with their undying no customer style of service. It was not United Airlines ticket that I purchased, it was under ANA but unfortunately, the operating flight was United. The check-in agent did not offer us any help that at least by reaching Haneda, a ground staff would assist us with our luggage to connect to another airline. I guess by customer's putting up their weak customer service to even lower than worst, keeps them in the market.

When we arrived (F16) they had not started boarding, so My wife left her phone and bag with me to use the bathroom. They had changed the gate to f17 with no notice and told me I needed to board and they’d wait for my wife. She didn’t have her phone or her ticket and I was rudely asked to board and leave my wife. They could have easily just explained let me take your carry on to load and wait for your wife. There would have been no way to communicate to my wife where she needed to go, where her bags went, and where I went. I wasn’t going to strand my wife and leave her behind. Then my wife returned and sprinted to get to the gate where I flagged her down. After getting on board, the gate attendant came back and continued berating me in front of the whole plane about not leaving my wife behind and denying to board until my wife was with me. Terrible service, never flying United again. I hope this gate attendant is made to undergo public relations training and learns how to speak politely to the people to the people who are why she gets paid.

Also, who ever handled cargo almost lost my luggage, I had to wait almost 24 hours to find out if they found it because it was a late transfer to the right connecting flight.

Me and my family cause a hold up for the other passengers by being the last people on board and the captain waited for us.

United,,,Apr-18,1,1," |  Newark to Dublin. Most unfriendly staff ever. We are a family of 3 flying with a 3 year old, the flight is early in the morning, so we had toddler, who was sleep deprived and  we had separate seats with my husband. We asked at the gate to help us to seat together, explaining that it’s easier to handle our son together, but nobody bothered, basically, we were told, that’s our issue. In the plane my son has tantrum with crying, we tried to talk to other passengers, asking if there is a way to switch, no luck. Flight attendants just pass by saying “You are his mom, deal with it”, threatening to stop the plane taking off if I couldn’t have him seated. My explanation that I need at least my husband’s help or the window seat (preferably the second) are ignored. Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight. In addition, there was no child meal that I ordered, and he refused to eat whatever they offered for adults (the food looked awful), so he had only muffin and a couple of cookies during the entire flight.

Both flights were first class. The outbound flight had a wonderful and friendly staff. But I was incredibly disappointed in the food choices. A burger is not an attractive option for a first class meal. Especially one with just cheese as a topping, and no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything. Plus I don’t eat meat, so I was thoroughly disappointed. Worse was the return flight. The seat, tray table and armrest was absolutely filthy. I did not feel comfortable sitting in the seat. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in days. Old food crumbs, hair, dust was prevalent. Could not believe United let this happen. I worked my way up in life to enjoy luxury. This ain’t luxury.

United,,,Mar-18,1,1," |  Nashville to Amsterdam via Washington-Dulles. We will never fly United again. Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurd…At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said ""invoice"" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that ""it will be fine and just keep printing them."" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason. The next morning we find out the United has not yet sent the form over or paid Westin for our stay. This is the third United flight I have taken in the last 2 months that has either been overbooked or cancel by mechanical failure. United flights are unreliable and their customer service is appalling. All they do is pass the blame and never resolve the issues they have caused. I urge you to not fly them and hopefully one day their awful customer service will put them out of business.",1,1,,31st March 2018,"""United flights are unreliable""", (United States) ,Nashville to Amsterdam via Washington-Dulles,1,Economy Class,1,Business,1,1,1

Flew from Detroit to Richmond VA with an 1.5 hour layover in Washington Dulles. Landed in Washington only to be told there was a 5 hour delay on my flight to Richmond. Considering that I needed to get to Richmond early, I asked if there were any other options. Spoke with multiple United employees and their response was to drive the rest of the way. I had no choice, so I decided to rent a car. Then I was told they would not get my luggage off the plane, even considering the plane was going to be there for 5 hours. After speaking to multiple employees, I luckily found one that retrieved my bag. Now on my return, i drive to Richmond airport and then receive a text telling my that my flight from Richmond to Washington Dulles is delayed 3 hours and I would not make my flight back to Detroit. Luckily I had not returned my rental car yet, I park and go in to speak to an agent. Once again, nothing they can do. I have to switch my rental location back to Washington Dulles and drive there as fast as I can to make my flight back home.

United,,,Mar-18,0,2," |  I scheduled a round trip from Ontario to San Francisco. I was told my flight was cancelled due to weather condition at the counter when I was trying to check, and they said they sent me a text, which I received during my check in. I asked the lady who works at the Untied Counter, what are the alternative since the flight is cancelled, she told me I can take another flight which is about 2 hours away (Burbank CA), or come back tomorrow, I asked her how do I get to Burbank, she told me ""I don't know, I don't deal with transportation."" Then I asked her ""Am I going to get reimbursement?"" she replied: ""I only check you in, I don't know about reimbursement, you should call United."" I was on a business trip and my schedule was tight, and as I insist on a solution, at the next counter, China Airline's employee felt bad and helped me to found a solution to fly from the same airport going to San Francisco. As I was waiting for my flight, I tried to contact United, I was trying to get an idea of the situation of my reimbursement, and was on queries for 2 hours, until I got on the plane. On the way back, as I got to the counter for check in, United Airline employee told me that my flight was cancelled because they put me on the Burbank flight (without my approval) and since I did not show up on the flight, they cancelled my round trip. They said they tried to contact me and maybe because I was in the sky when they called, but since I didn't call them back, I am liable for this result. At the counter I just wanted to go home and told them I just want to buy a ticket now (I already told my friends when to pick me up, and unlike United, I don't want to change what was schedule.) And the lady was like you can buy it with your phone. I insisted on her booking the ticket for me (I didn’t want to have the risk of, where I brought a ticket online and the counter told me they can't find it) then she tried to book me for about 10 minutes and told me ""I am going to have to stop booking for you since you are about to past the 30 minutes limit to board the flight."" And Later on I found out the person who is ""more"" familiar with the ticketing was on lunch. The most disgusting part is their attitude and the situation they put you in, ""I am not responsible for your schedule.""

United,,,Feb-18,1,1," |  My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didn’t know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didn’t know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. That’s when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (that’s four if you’re counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and that’s when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause he’s allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. I’m not the only allergy sufferer and you’ll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet.

United,,,Feb-18,0,1, | United has always let me down whenever I have flown with them. They are usually delayed and had me wait over two hours for a flight before. So when I was going home by them again I accepted that it wasn’t going to be a fun trip. I didn’t know it was going to be this bad. First off my flight started off late and the plane got to the airport 20 minutes later then we should have. They did not tell us why we were late though. Not only was it late but we had to wait longer than necessary to get our carry-on luggage that wouldn’t fit on the actual plane. Due to all of this we missed our connecting flight. When we finally found the right gate (since it was switched on us at least twice) the flight had already boarded and the door closed. The attendant at the desk was rude and condenscending when she told us that it was closed and the plane left. We proceeded to wait in the customer service line for two hours in order to talk to a rep who didn’t know anything and had to ask her supervisor on every little question. She tried to figure out why the flight was late but found no reason or explanation why. She said yes the flight was delayed but since there was no reason for it she could not get us a hotel room or even a discount on one. The next flight to South Dakota wasn’t until ten the next morning which would have been too late for the event we needed to get to. We asked if we could be refunded and found a flight back to Tulsa. After a lengthy phone call they decided that they can only get us on the next flight back to Tulsa which was at 2pm the next day and if we want to be refunded we will have to call a number and jump through some more hoops even though it’s the airlines fault for us missing our connecting. We asked if we could possibly fly back on Sunday. Since we were already in Denver we didn’t want to shoot our entire weekend down the drain. She replied with a no due to policy. So here we are in the Denver airport at 10.30 at night with no luggage food or a room. We are missing a baptism. With how we were treated and hurt I am now going to make every effort to never fly United again.

United,,,Dec-17,0,2," |  Montreal to New York with United, connecting to Avianca and Tam to Sao Paulo / Salvador. My partner and I won't fly again with United Airlines. First of all, they started by ""forgetting"" to reimburse us a pair of tickets (worth more than 3000$), even after we called to make sure we had not been ticketed. When we had tried to purchase our ticket, they were not able to confirm to us our tickets within 24 hours, so their policy was that our tickets would be canceled - we would not be charged. We took extra precautions by calling them to make sure we were not charged, and were reassured that we would not be charged. One month later we find out in our credit card statement that we had actually been charged. This is not a mistake of charging 10$ extra to costumers, it's more than 3000$! Moreover, we had to wait about 2 weeks to get the full reimbursement once we called them. And lot's of talking over the phone. Second, during our trip, we wanted to change the origin and date of one of our flights. However, when calling United Airlines during multiple days and talking to several agents, some would say we could not change the origin of our ticket. No where on the ticket does it say we cannot change the origin. Also, we spoke to about 5 agents who told us all kinds of different rules and policies (often contradictory) - all with the same end: they would not let us change one of our flights. They told us we had to ""stick to our initial route"" and there were not changes possible.

United,,,Feb-18,0,0," |  Houston to Los Angeles. Before my first flight departed, I expressed concern to a flight attendant, because there was only 16 minutes from when the flight landed until my next flight started boarding. She stated to me that we would probably be arriving early so there would be enough time for me and they could ask the passengers to remain seated letting me off the plane. Neither these things were true. I get to the gate at LAX three minutes passed when boarding was meant to end. It is isolated and not a single employee nor other passengers are around. I pace around looking for someone but the doors are shut. I rush back to a staffed customer service stand for answers. The woman I had the displeasure of talking to was in ""Customer Service."" Can I have your last name? No. Do you have an employee identification number? I can't give it to you. She calls my gate and discovers the employees were in the jetway. She then continues to bang away on her computer keyboard for several minutes. There was absolutely NO attempt to help me make my flight. She notifies me that the soonest I can leave is not until tomorrow afternoon. I tell that is not going to work for me. She does not care. That was that. What else can you do? Nothing. How else can I get there? You can drive. I openly express my frustration. About how I asked for help from the flight attendant, she does not care. I demand that there must be something else she can do and at this she picks up the phone to call security. She then says to me ""we're done, you are not willing to listen, we're done."" And at this, refuses to help me and sends me away. I come back to her and said that I was going to need a hotel room for the night. She responds with, ""I am not helping you with anything."" You are not going to get me a hotel? She uses this as an opportunity to lecture and chastise me about I should have listened to her and if I wouldn't have left the terminal [to find a human being to help me] then I wouldn't have missed my flight.

We walked up to the computer to start our check in process and got to the point at which we needed a United official to assist (since we were flying basic economy). It took the 5 ladies behind the desk about 15 minutes to make their way to us. This is remarkable knowing that only about 4 computers were in use and we had our hands raised/waving for 5 minutes. The employees  ignored us until we  waved at one while reaching over the counter. When the lady finally made her way over to us she took us to check the size of our backpacks in the personal item container. It was a tight fit but they could definitely fit. The lady began to explain that if we did not check our bags, they would charge us at the gate a higher fee. We have ridden basic economy on about 6 flights each (a total of 12 flights) and have never had an issue fitting our bags under the seats in front of us. This lady was saying ""they are going to grab you at the gate and make you pay $100.""  She then went on to record our information after approving us.

They moved her seat four times! Each time I had to call and say, she can not be put in economy, that is not what I paid for, and she can not be in a window seat! She has to be able to flag an attendant if she needs something! They tried putting her in a window seat, economy instead of premium economy, etc.. Dealing with a person that has Alzheimer's is bad enough, dealing with a horrible airline that I had to call several times to argue about why they cant move her seat is just horrible.

United,,,Jan-18,1,1," |  Boston to Hong Kong via Newark. My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this ""service"". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: ""We are nice to people who are nice to us"", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don't gamble with it.

Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight. Furthermore, there was no apology from crew until the flight landed in Heathrow where the crew finally apologised and said passengers to go online and get an appreciation voucher from United. This when I did that it gave me a USD100 discount code on any United Airlines with many conditions attached to it, unfortunately I won’t be flying United again at any cost, therefore even this voucher is of no use.

At the airport almost 30 people were on standby for our flight. Then we were delayed over an hour. Then we flew to Houston, TX for a two hour layover. Then back on a plane to Tulsa.

I'm happy the gate employee at least explained my situation but this is ridiculous. United wanted to charge me another $35 for this trip to be economy. I paid $75 so that's nearly a increase.

However, when there's something as simple as putting a passenger, with no carry on or checked luggage, on the same size aircraft going to the same destination and United won't do it.

The lady that gave us our flights for the next day gave us a discount for a hotel. Needless to say I didn’t put a hotel stay in Houston in my budget. I will never fly United ever again and the only way they can make up for giving me the worst start to my vacation is a full refund.

We checked in two days before the flight and reserved seats, my one was 24K, so we do not sit split across the whole plane. When we arrived at the gate in Zurich, they gave us new Boarding cards with other seats across the whole plane. As we flew with our children, my wife and me would like to sit next to them. But United couldn't change the seats, so we had to accept it. Finally in the plane, most of the flight attendants were very rude, there was just one friendly FA on board. The food tasted horrible. It was the worst I've ever eaten in my whole life. Also the wifi didn't work. During the flight, the FA's were gone, we couldn't order something to drink and all the rubbish had to go into the seat pocket. Just before landing they handed out something like a Leach-Pizza piece.

United,,,Dec-17,1,1," |  Newark to Savannah. Extremely disappointed in my recent experience with United. I was flying back home from EWR with my carry-on dog. I had all the necessary paperwork, carrier, and I had purchased the dog a ticket as instructed (note: this was my first time flying with my dog on a United flight, I usually fly JetBlue with her). When I go to board the woman scanning my ticket said she was changing my seat for me. I said ""thank you"" thinking that would be a nice gesture, but I was wrong. Once on board she came on the plane and told me that I was not allowed to sit in that seat (the one she changed me to) with a pet because it had no seat in front of it to stow the animal. I asked if I could move back to my original seat and she told me no. The flight attendants, as well as other people on the plane tried to talk her into letting me change my seat and she still refused, called a manager, and proceeded to kick me off of my flight. It was the most HORRIFIC experience in my entire life. She booked me on a later flight and forgot to transfer my dog over to that ticket, so when I boarded the later flight they were giving me a difficult time having the dog. This I do understand because they didn't have a record of it. However, once we got it all sorted out and everything was fine, they attendants refused to give me any water or take my trash. It was like I never existed on the flight! I am blown away by how inconsiderate and rude United was to me. From the ticket lady to the flight attendants on my later flight. It seems that across the board they value unprofessional behavior. I am originally from NJ so I do understand the somewhat lack of compassion inside the actual airport, but that isn't something that should transfer over to the airline or flight.

I checked in at Jackson, MS and could not carry my dress on, or they’d charge me $50. So I had to check the bag, which I was NEVER told about a baggage charge, two of us flying, 4 bags checked - $120.00!!! Then, I understood the small aircraft to Houston, but to Aspen? Seriously? I will say the staff on the second flight was very nice but the pretzels served, all 5 of them (yes sarcasm), the pretzels were smaller than my fingernail but what really made me disgusted was when they were picking up the trash, we noticed they stacked the plastic drinking cups, trust me they were cocktail size cups, later they came by offering water & I realized they simply rinsed the cups!",1,1,,5th December 2017,"""never book a flight with United again""", (Austria) ,Jackson to Aspen via Houston ,1,Economy Class,1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1

When I got to airport I missed my flight because I was told I needed a round trip ticket to board and the only one they had available was over $800 I’d have to purchase 3 of them right away and I couldn’t afford it. When I let the United Airlines representative know I was a Costa Rican citizen she asked if my 12 year old and 2 year old “where Costa Rican citizens as well” when I told her no she continued to ask if “they had same father, because I’d need consent from them to leave the country” I thought that question was extremely rude and felt she asked me that only because of my ethnicity due to the fact she asked if I spoke English right from the start without me even speaking! Honestly made me cry from feeling so humiliated.

I did not receive notice that my flights were being delayed. Santa Rosa was fogged in, told me I could take a shuttle or drive myself to San Francisco to make my connecting flight, but would not comp the shuttle ride, even though the other airlines were and no compensation for the fact that I was only using half of the flight I paid for. On my way back to Santa Rosa from Portland they delayed my flight by 3 hours, once again with no notice sent to me, and then made my lay over in San Fran 4.5 hours. When I asked for my luggage to take another shuttle since I only live an hour and a half away, they told me I would have to wait 2 hours to get it. They said I could pick it up in Santa Rosa since it would fly with or without me on the plane. I agreed and took the shuttle to Santa Rosa. When I got to the Santa Rosa airport, I went to United and asked about picking up my bag, they said that I could not pick it up after 6pm because they were closed but could deliver my bag to me instead, they took my address name and phone number as well as my bag number. I watched them (I could see and read the screen) pull up my bag info in their system and attach it to an email with all my information and directions on delivering my bag next day to my address between 6-8pm. 6-8pm comes and call the airline, get the run around about them saying that the person I spoke to never submitted a claim, and they have no record of the email that I watched him send being sent. Had to repeatly insist on speaking to a supervisor before being put through only to end up still without any idea of when or if I'll get my luggage back.

Although we were prepared for and anticipated heavy traffic during those times, we were pleasantly surprised that everything went smoothly and we arrived at our destination a little earlier than expected. Both flights were smooth with just a little turbulence.

The worst part is you are forced to pay with credit card if you want to see old movies such as The Lion King or Office Space. How can they rip you off that badly? They force to travel like sardines, they have no empty seats so checking in and out of flights involves standing in long lines to make sure that when you get on board your carry-on luggage will have space. They keep asking us for our cooperation because of a full flight. What do they do to make sure we have an enjoyable flight? We have to pay for food if we want it, pay for entertainment and suffer through the entire flight with the extra tiny space that they have given us in, for example, a Boeing 737.

Im not someone that flies all the time, so I didn't know I needed to get this taken care of within 24 hours, flying for the first time in 10 years and flying to Chicago was scary and it was a business trip. So I decided to wait until I got back to Richmond as I figured my bag would just get destroyed more.

We all disembarked and general panic set in amongst those of us who were connecting in Houston. The experienced flyers amongst us understood that a one hour mechanical delay is usually the precursor to a cancelled flight, a missed connection, and an overnight stay in Houston. The harried gate agents began to reschedule connecting passengers. They had made some progress with the long line of nervous customers when at exactly one hour later, the head agent came on the PA to announce that a hydraulic leak had been repaired and that we were ready to reboard and depart for IAH. On both flights, I had the window seat in the forward over-wing emergency exit with the middle seat unoccupied. This is the seat I always reserve because the leg room is awesome and the passenger in front of you can't recline into your space. On the IAH-SJO flight I had the whole row to myself, which in some aspects is better than getting upgraded to 1st class. Pretzels and beverages were distributed efficiently on both flights, and more elaborate snacks and meals were available for purchase.

Having flowing in and out of McCarran International Airport quite frequently on early morning flights, I knew that I should be able to move through things fairly quickly. I arrived at the airport at 5:05 AM. I went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and was stopped. United Airlines employees told me that I was too late to get on my 5:50 AM flight, and that I would have to wait in the ticketing line to rebook my flight. I kept trying to explain to them that at I still had over forty-five minutes until my flight left and that I wasn't checking any baggage, but they wouldn't listen to me. Instead, they forced me to stand in a ticketing line for 20 minutes by which point it really was too late for me to make the flight. When I got to the counter the woman rebooking me acted as though I was checking my back. When I explained that I wasn't, she got what can only be described as an ""oh no"" look on her face. Then, she very apologetically explained to me that a mistake had been made, and that I should have been permitted to pass through and get on the flight. Apparently, despite having tried to explain the exact same thing multiple times to the other employees they chose to stop me anyway. I had missed the cut off for passengers trying to check luggage (45 mins) but not for people just trying to print their boarding pass and go straight through to the flight (30 mins). What made it even more frustrating was that I arrived in the terminal at the gate for my first flight before it had even taken off. At that point, I should have been offered some sort of compensation for the wasted time, but United didn't give me anything.

We were disappointed with United two years ago (last time we flew them), now we are absolutely disgusted.

United,Boeing 787,,Sep-17,1,2," |  Boston to Shanghai via Chicago. It has been years since I flew United and I forgot how bad it is. They totally milk their ORD frequent flyers. Departure lounge is spare with no food or alcohol. The business class seat configuration is 8 seats across, barely wider than coach and less place for a bag than coach. Both flights took too more than an hour late with no explanation or apology. Flight attendants bark orders. Wi-Fi broken with no explanation or apology. Meal choice - forget it, only one left unless you're 100K in which case they will literally take the meal of another passenger for you. AC power outlet broken, so no charging for 15 hours. This is like a third world airline.

You will be charged for every step along the way and don't expect staff to be friendly or helpful.

The plane was not full. This is the first time an airline place my kids away from me. One kids fell sleep and the other came up to me on my middle seat. The guy next to me tried to help and moved one row forward to the emergency row so my boy could be next to me. Immediately a sour purser came and threw him back as the emergency row is a premium seat on United. I understand their policy but do think the purser could have helped. Lounge food is very low quality compared to Lufthansa or BA. We are gold and silver level on SA which seems to be only reason to fly United so you can board early and bring more luggage,3,1,,10th September 2017,"""The unfriendly skies""", (United States) ,Newark to Mexico City,3,Economy Class,1,Family Leisure,2,1,1

A day before our scheduled departure, I canceled my husband's flight because he had a bad cold and was coughing too much to get on a plane. In my conversation with United, I was told how to file for a refund (even though my tickets were non-refundable). I traveled to San Francisco myself. The direct flight both ways went fine, but the return flight was remarkable. By chance, I ended up sitting next to my sister and brother-in-law who were returning to Boston from the same funeral. We chatted with one of the flight attendants who knew we were returning from a funeral. She was exceptionally kind and gave us complimentary snacks. Her kindness was greatly appreciated during our bereavement. After I returned home, I filled out the online Refund form to see about getting a refund for my husband's ticket. I explained that not only was he coughing too much to get on a plane for six hours but it would have been very inconsiderate to other passengers for him to be hacking away. United Airlines was kind enough to promptly issue a refund for my husband's unused round-trip fare - a full refund, not a credit for future travel. I appreciate the refund - the thought of having to pay for an unused round-trip ticket for a funeral would only add insult to injury. I am grateful to United Airlines for making a very unpleasant situation (me traveling across the country alone, without my husband, for my cousin's funeral) as comfortable and pleasant as they could.",5,10,yes,10th September 2017,"""grateful to United Airlines""", (United States) ,Boston to San Francisco,4,Economy Class,5,Couple Leisure,5,1,0

The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me ""that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone"" well I am a 5'10"" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight.

We both had 2 bags weighing of which one was weighing 67lbs and the other ones 70lbs. Upon check in, someone who acted like the manager in charge helps us get the baggage tags from a machine and then put our bags on the scale. He told us they were overweight and that we had to pay for the extra lbs. We did not agree because we had weighed the bags before and they were good to go. An argument started and the man became very rude to us. Then we took the bags and put them on another counter scale and the weights were exactly like the ones we had measured ourselves before going to the airport. Then my daughter started taking pictures of the scales and suddenly another employee came to us and said ""don't worry it's ok you can go""! Apparently, the company seems to use inaccurate scales to get some extra money from voyagers. This is unacceptable and I am filing a complaint with the company. My advice is that you weigh your bags before going to the airport and once there ask to double check on different scales.",1,4,,7th September 2017,"""seems to use inaccurate scales""", (United States) ,San Francisco to Boston,4,Business Class,3,Business,2,1,0

To be fair though, and to set aside all my prior experiences I will review the flight from a fresh slate. The aircraft, a 17 year old 777 with the old Continental interior. There was personal in seat IFE but it was slow and unresponsive. The movies that were available were recent and best sellers. I was very happy to see that the drink cart was busted out maybe 4 times during the flight and about every hour there was an FA distributing water. Flight was only about 20 minutes. Food itself was a choice between western and asian meal. To be honest, none of the meals were good. But what kills me the most about United is the horrible customer service, flight attendants are all rude and cold.

It amazes me how you can wait for an hour to rebook a flight only to have the gate attendant look at the line and say ""we have other flights to deal with, if you were on the moved / delayed flight, take it somewhere else. We're not dealing with any more of you."" Made it to the next gate and had to convince that attendant just to check and see if I'd make a 10pm connection. Her answer was ""no"" and she seemed to think her job was complete. Waiting on hold and in lines for hours just to be told I won't make it home. No effort whatsoever to actually rebook or solve the problem. Of course no compensation or hotel was offered after finally rebooking for the next morning after being on hold with United for almost an hour. Pay hundreds of dollars for a service, and they truly seem to have no to minimum interest in actually delivering that service to you.",1,2,,7th September 2017,"""Staff were rude and unhelpful""", (United States) ,Atlanta to San Francisco,2,Economy Class,3,Solo Leisure,2,1,2
United,,,Aug-17,0,3," |  Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn't be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip. Our travel experience was awful, and if United would at least compensate for some of that ridiculous amount of extra money we spent, I would be way happier right now.

Overall, it was a poor to average experience. On the ground (US side) their staff can definitely be better trained. I'm a vegetarian so I requested a special meal - probably the worst airplane food I've ever had. Don't bother requesting the vegetarian meal and just risk the regular food service where they usually have a meatless pasta/noodle option. The seats in premium economy have a good amount of legroom and the entertainment on board isn't bad either. I think my biggest issue with the experience overall was the disinterest of the flight attendants. After being repeatedly hit by the cart going by and the patronizing tone the FAs used when giving me the veggie meal, it makes you wonder how they continue to use their 'friendly skies' pitch.

I paid for my carry on bags and got on the plane. We ended up having to land the plane in Atlanta because of weather. The staff told us we should only have a few hours layover and be back up in the air. A few hours passed by and we were told to board the plane. We all got on and sat for 30 minutes then we're told to get back off because there was no pilot. That itself annoyed me because it's a waste of time. We were told we had to stay in Atlanta. They gave me my carry on bag because everything I needed was in it and since I was going to be stuck in the airport over night I wanted to brush my teeth and use deodorant and have my phone charger to charge my phone. After the staff gave me my carry on bags. I was told I'd have to pay the baggage fee again. This delay and overnight stay in the airport is not my problem and I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my bag again. Ridiculous. I told the staff is there anyway they could accommodate for unexpected food and bag fee to wave it and maybe give me a voucher for food. I was told by all the staff that because I was a solo traveler, that they would not make any exceptions for me and told me they have more important things to deal with. I explained to them that my bank had locked my card because I tried to use it in the airport so I had no money and it was to late to contact my bank. The only cash I had on me had to go towards this carry on bag fee. The staff told me they could not help me and I needed to go find a spot to relax until the next plane had a seat for me. I am extremely upset with the carry on bag fees, the staff were very rude not only to me but everyone. I am upset that we had to sleep in the airport over night with no food or drinks offered to us.

I had to wait until they served the meals and everyone was busy eating to be able to connect. I have to say, later during the flight it was better, but i guess because most people were bored from trying and just went to sleep. I am not a tall person, and I never notice leg room, but not on this flight. It is noticeably crammed. Seats are old and torn in places. I unfolded the tray and seat in front was torn. They provide electrical sockets under the seat. However, due to short leg room, it is very hard to plug anything in, and to even keep it without knocking it out. Food is a disaster.

Originally our route was supposed to be Seattle - Chicago - Norfolk, but a day or two before our flight United changed the route to go through Newark instead. We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again.

United,,,Jul-17,1,1," | I have not travelled with United Airline for about a year. The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins. United Airlines is a prime example of corporations that wrongly put profit before customer experience. In my next time flying, I will surely stay away from United Airlines.",1,1,,10th July 2017,"""stay away from United Airlines""", (United States) ,San Francisco to Phoenix,1,Economy Class,1,Family Leisure,1,1,1

However, after an hour and a half, the crew didn't want to wait any more and went home. At that point, my 9:17pm flight got bumped to 8:30 am.

United,,,May-17,1,1," | Extremely disappointed with the treatment of a first-class passenger. We purposely booked our 16 year old daughter in first class so she could feel safe with the attention of the airline staff since she was traveling a long way by herself (Denver to Boston). She was booked in row 3A, and upon arriving at the gate, was called to the counter. The gate agent said, ""We are trying to find a seat for you"". No explanation. She called me upset because she did not know what was going on. I told her to go back to the counter and show them her itinerary and confirmation. She did, and the same agent responded with, ""There is a broken seat in first class. We are trying to find a seat for you"". Again, no confirmation that she will get eventually get a seat on the flight. My daughter looks at the available seats being displayed on the monitor and notices middle seats available from row 10 and up. Thirty minutes goes by with no communication. Then my husband asks to speak to the agent via my daughter's cell phone, and the exchange was so heated, the agent slammed the phone down on the counter. My daughter picked up her phone and walked away from the counter without either gate agent saying a word to her. Simple, clear communication showing they care would have gone a long way instead of leaving a 16 year old in tears. I ended up calling United and the agent switched me to a manager right away. The manager said she was being assigned seat 21A window seat (even thought the gate agents at that point still hadn't said anything to her); or the reservation manager could switch her to a first class seat on the 12:30pm flight instead of her 9:50am flight. My daughter preferred to wait until the 12:30pm flight just to avoid the gate agents. A simple, caring, clear communication from the gate agents would have avoided a lot of anxiety, anger, and tears. I know she would have easily taken row 21A if she wasn't so upset, but now she never wants to fly United again, and I don't blame her.

Yes I was asking for a ""favor"", for my own convenience but i figured if there was room, why wouldn't an airline take care of its customers? After talking to customer service, they confirmed the flight to have many empty seats. Unfortunately unless I was premium status, there was a standby fee of $75 per one way flight. Wouldn't it be easier to keep customers happy whenever possible? Beyond customer service, this is bad business practices. The airline business is time critical; once a flight leaves, an airline can't make any more money from that flight for ticket sales. By moving up passengers to earlier flights, an airline can reserve the future potential to sell more seats on later flights. Why would an airline limit future growth potentinal? Especially when at the expense of the customer experience.

While checking in bags for a flight from KOA to PDX the credit machines /kiosks went down and though the ticket agent asked us to try several times (3 to be exact) we were not able to pay on the kiosk with a credit card. We waited patiently with the attendants and a growing line of passengers behind us for over a half hour.

She checked us in for our flight printed our bag tags and boarding passes and we went on our way, boarded, and flew home. Today there are three separate charges for $75 each on my bank card, for a transaction I was assured was free! Unacceptable. I was extremely patient and understand that tech issues happen but there is no excuse for poor customer service from the 800 number provided by the charging agent. When calling the phone number next to the 3 transactions on my bank account for customer service I was told that they can't help me! Why have customer service agents that cannot fix problems. I am currently waiting on the phone and have been waiting for an hour and five minutes for a resolution to this problem and will certainly be filing a formal complaint. To top it all off, during my call with customer service the supervisor that I spoke with tried to blame the ticket agent! All of the agents at the airport, physically checking passengers in did a great job under the conditions. With every kiosk down they managed to help all of the passengers checking in for their flights while dealing with technical issues. I'm certain there are several other passengers that have experienced the same problem! I stood at the counter and waited while the gate agent called for assistance and was told it was a system wide problem or slow age.

However, my 14 hour economy flight was probably about as enjoyable as any economy flight can be. United flies the lovely new 787 on this route, the air quality is better, the lighting is better and the seats, although they look really small, are actually amongst the most comfortable I have flown on. Video Entertainment is great, although the lack of audio was a bit frustrating, take your phone or Ipad along for this. Wi-Fi for purchase is a fun option to pass the time and costs are reasonable. The food was OK, a meal on departure, a snack in between and then a rubbery egg breakfast before landing in LA. The reality is this was an economy flight, the fare was really really good value. We resisted the constant sales push before the flight to purchase economy plus which does provide extra leg room if you feel you need it, at least with United have this option at a pretty reasonable rate if you feel you need it.

The agents kept us up to date and were optimistic that time would be made up and the outbound flight held a few minutes to accommodate enroute passengers. Apparently, meals for first class were not delivered on the previous flight and the gate agent ran down to buy 8 meals to make sure we got fed. The United staff did an excellent job in hurrying boarding and making sure those with tight connections had a good shot at making the next flight. It all worked out! I made the flight to New Orleans.

Shabby plane with very uncomfortable seats, tortoise like speed of service (why can Southwest serve drinks twice as fast?) and then the inevitable delays. Having been on 3 or 4 domestic flights this trip it seems at least part of United's problem is the endemic lack of capacity at key US airports like LGA. Every time delays taking off, delays finding a gate on arrival. All very frustrating. I thought the UK was bad at infrastructure with LHR running at 99.9% capacity but at least there are only delays there when there's a specific problem. At US airports it seems routine.

After an hour on hold, I spoke to a supervisor who told me that this couldn't be accomplished and that my wife would have to pay a fee for her first bag! The supervisor told me there was no way she could waive this fee. This seems like a bait and switch operation for both United and Chase VISA.

Given that my return time to Boston had become critical, staff at ORD suggested paying fee [$450] to return via San Francisco the day prior, which I then did. Beijing  to San Francisco leg was delayed departing, and arrived at SFO gate with 50 mins before scheduled SFO-BOS leg. I made it to gate but was informed that my itinerary [in First] had been switched, to a coach seat 4hrs later. At this point, UA were still offering first class seats for sale [including mine] on both the original SFO-BOS leg and also the later SFO-BOS flight.  This generated some amusement from the UA baggage handlers and gate staff which was at best disrespectful. After 30 days back and forth they refunded the class difference sum [$220 from a total of >$3400] but refused to refund change fees or offer explanation regarding selling on available seats [including mine] or offering a First class seat option [which I had paid for]. As a result, this was my last ever UA flight. I have flown BOS-PEK and BOS-LHR eight times since this incident with other carriers and have been rewarded with premium level service in the air and on the ground.

When it was getting closer to the delayed time, they delay again to 12:xx. Again, when it was almost 12:xx, they delay it to 1:xx. Several times!  The most annoying thing is that they didn't even know when it could fly, and they came to ask your decision, if you wanted to fly today, or tomorrow! OK, if it was myself, I could handle it. But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai. She definitely needed assistance in SFO, either logde into an hotel or some place for rest. When I call United's customer service (headquarter), they couldn't connect me to their branch in SFO. My mother-in-law had to find the United counter by herself. When I asked what to do with her checked-in luggages. They said my mother-in-law needed to picked it up from carousel and re-check it!

First Class fares in the US are not much more (if at all) than many economy fares in Australia so I suspect economy/coach passengers in the US on United have little to complain about - there is no such thing as a free lunch! The United Club before boarding was fine except the food offerings were not so good. Picking up a boarding pass coming in from an international flight was not so good either - very slack staff, However, once on board, I really enjoyed being able to chat to the flight crew on boarding and afterwards as well as the good wine.

Upon returning to the airport in the morning, there were a couple hundred people in line and no United staff at the check-in counter.

He introduced all the crew and also explained that he was holding the flight for a passenger on an international connection since this was the last flight to RDU that evening. But even with the hold we would get to RDU early. Flight was reasonably smooth with occasional bumpiness but the captain changed altitude several times to find smoother air. Cabin staff were pleasant and the premium economy seating was fine (though it was the most expensive premium economy I have purchased on any of the 3 legacy carriers.)

United,Boeing 767-400ER,,Dec-16,1,1,"The Polaris disaster with United Airlines. Washington IAD to Zurich on a 767-400ER. Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a “polar bear” teddy bear, so there’s no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didn’t guarantee that I’d have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. I’ve never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when he’s in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed “what would you like” rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink. Now a piece of the siding underneath where the table is stowed is unhinged and flapping loosely. Who’s got a piece of tape? To top it off, my appetizer was frozen (including the salad) and the bread was cold and stale. Good luck, UA, with Polaris. So far, not impressed. Same miserable UA crew with bad attitudes (although the Cabin Service Director was polite and apologetic when I told him what his colleague had said to me about the call button). This has been a rude awakening after regularly flying Qatar Airways for the last two years.

We departed the plane and was out for another 2 minutes before telling us to reboard. We couldn't take off right away which made us late and when we finally did we knew we weren't going to catch the next flight. They told us to just go to customer service and get a new flight. When we reach Newark, we did just that. We got another flight pretty close to the other one. We boarded like normal, and five minutes in, they tell us they have to change the brakes. They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren't going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn't land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am. They offered us free alcoholic drinks because of the long wait. When my friend and I ordered she rudely asked for ID like we were lying or something and then made us split a drink instead of giving us one each. 4 days go by and it was time to go home.

The man at the desk said, ""I believe you will still make it, I can move your seats closer to the front to make sure you get off the plane in time."" We obviously believed him. It took us a while to get in the air and when we landed we rushed off and ran to our gate. It was closed. When I asked the man at the counter about it he said ""listen, I didn't work the flight."" I never asked if he did. I was then told to go to customer service. When I did so, the woman said she would put us on the 9:30pm flight to Hartford since that was the one leaving next. I was supposed to be in Hartford at 4pm. I didn't want to be in the airport for another 6 hours and get home by 10pm.

Dublin airport offers pre-clearance and as such I was attracted to the flight with United Airlines. First impressions count and I am afraid that I was not at all impressed with the gate staff – some of whom were in United uniforms and boarded the flight after their gate duties. Their rudeness towards an elderly couple was disgusting and simply ignorant. Boarding was done in groups. Some passengers did not have their groups shown on their tickets and the staff had an aloof manners towards those who simply asked for the process to be explained. One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirs’s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse. The second uniformed United staff member I spoke to get my boarding pass was actually very friendly and polite and informative too.

The male flight attendant on this flight very obviously did not like his job - he never once smiled, never once said thank you, please, your welcome - it was if we were an inconvenience to this man.  I have never in all my years of travel, encountered a more surly flight attendant. Once we arrive to Chicago (we were on route to Toronto) we deplaned the aircraft and went in search of a board to see what our next gate would be - none were immediately available to us and we walked quite a way in terminal 1. I asked a United ground staff person how we get to Toronto and showed her my ticket, and she proceeded to send us to Terminal 5 - which is outside the security area and at the far end of the airport. This required taking the train, walking a fair distance, and once we arrived the ground staff at the entrance to this terminal advised us we needed to return to Terminal 1! Needless to say, we were not happy. Our flight was scheduled to depart 1 hour after we arrived at this airport (Chicago) and when we finally cleared security (again) and made our way back, the flight was already boarded and our overhead bins were full. And we were flying in seat 2b and 2d (I may have the seat numbers incorrect, but you get the idea - we were again in Business class.) This flight was a treat - the flight attendants were very pleasant, and had to deal with my ranting about being sent all over the airport by United ground staff. The flight was uneventful, but much better than the LA to Chicago route. United needs to get their people trained properly.

Flight departed and arrived on time. The flight Newark - Los Angeles a full flight, but the flight attendants were there with good, cheerful service, with water, beverages, even a decent hot meal for purchase that was better than expected. The leg room in economy plus was adequate in bulkhead seats - overall it gave me hope that United is trying to improve its service and on time performance.

So, after the 4.5 hours of delay we were finally called to board. The flight was good, and we hoped to find that the flight in the evening got delayed so we didn't have to stay in an airport hotel and hop on the flight the next morning. So, we get to Newark and realize on the United app that our flight to SJO had taken off 2 min before we landed. We passed through security, which took 1 hour 20 min, we went to the counter and asked for a hotel room to spend the night and hop on the flight we had already been booked in for SJO the next morning. The whole flight was in there, trying to do the same as us, so we spent another 2 hrs shouting at the counter lady who didn't want to give us a room.

Since we wanted good seats, we booked early and got seats on the two-seat side very far up in Economy Plus. (That plane has a 2-5-2 configuration.) However, when we printed out our boarding pass the day before the flight, United had left my wife with the window seat but moved me about 25 yards back in the 5-seat section. We were shocked. There was no change of equipment, which might have explained it. No explanation, no apology. When we got to the airport, I said to the attendant at our gate that we chose our seats well in advance, so by rights those two seats together should be ours. She gave me a sly smile and said, in effect, ""No, you have no right to those seats. United retains the right to reassign seating for no reason or any reason, and that's what we've done."" Chalk it up to declining competition in the airline industry. With so few competitors, United feels they can treat their customers like pawns that they freely move around on the board at their whim. Last April we flew on United from Paris to Chicago non-stop. Once the doors were closed and the pilot taxiing to the runaway, the flight attendant said, in effect, ""You think we're flying non-stop from Paris to Chicago. We're not. We're flying from Paris to Newark where this flight will end."" The explanation: the pilot's maximum flying hours expired when we got to Newark.

On August 30th I get an automated email saying that my flight is scheduled as planned. I noticed that they had the wrong time of flight in the email. So, I went online and verified the correct flight time (a flight at the time they sent me didn't exist). When I arrived at the airport and began the check-in process there was no record of me in the system. The kiosks gave me ""not found"" and the personnel at the counters confirmed the same. My flight was in two hours and I was starting to panic. I called United Airlines and got an agent. I explained my situation, told the agent that it was urgent and I was about to miss my flight, and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The agent put me on a very long hold and then disconnected me. After a number of similar calls to the call center I finally got an agent - an hour later - that told me that somebody at UA had deleted my record from the system on the morning of my flight and I no longer had a seat on that plane. Really UA? Wow. Given the number of long holds, disconnects, and agents not able to correctly diagnose and resolve the problem from the start, I missed my flight. I had to take a later flight that day which made a mess of my plans. I will not use United Airlines again. It bends my mind that an airline could simply remove a paying customer from a confirmed flight without notification and leave him to sort out the mess at check-in. A mess that was met, not with any apologies or concern for my predicament, but with endless hold times, disconnects, and supervisors that are ""too busy at the moment"".

I approached the counter and told the woman of my concerns, if there was a flight I could catch sooner, fly to a different hub, etc. she said I would be fine. My reply was that if the flight was delayed even 1 more minute I would miss my connection. 4 hours later were supposed to start boarding and I get a new notification saying my flight was delayed another hour. I was going to miss my connection. I approached the desk, there were now no more flights that could get me to my destination, none even in the same state as my destination!

I wasted my PTO of two days, shortening my vacation, wasted money on cab fares to and from my house and back for my next flight, they don't reimburse and just frustration that they couldn't be proactive in the situation to find a solution. So here I am two days later, didn't get to choose my seat, I'm checking in and notice there are aisle seats further up than mine that are open and I ask the woman at the desk to please change my seat.

United,,,Jul-16,1,1," |  Flew United Airlines, first class from Los Angeles - Chicago and return. Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually ""snipped"" was more like it) ""no, we have only one serving per person"". For a first class ticket, you can't get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever,  two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we'd even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I've never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn't hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well. The only redeeming value on the flight were the more comfortable seatings and the fact that the pilot seemed experienced. My question on this flight: other than the more comfortable seats - what did I pay for? This was a very poor excuse for what was supposed to be a first class flight.

No information on the hotel number or address or shuttle. Just the name and there were two in the city. Not being from the US I then had to use roaming charges to try and find my reservation.

The screens are small with poor resolution and the sound for the video wasn't working on this flight. Still, all was set up with fresh pillows and blankets and the plane was clean. The thing that made this trip even better was that the economy cabin was empty. My guess is there were 25 of us in back with the front two cabins almost full. The lunch was decent though the portions were quite small. I don't like the pre-landing snack so I always bring my own food onboard for that meal. Flight attendants were friendly. In fact, everyone in Economy was in a good mood that day and, who wouldn't be with all of that room. We were delayed in London due to traffic and weather. Arrived in Chicago having made up about half of the delay. Baggage was out in a very acceptable amount of time. I do this route a fair amount and it is usually one of United's best. Much of that has to do with the London ground staff which is often exceptional and some of the flight attendants who routinely work this route.

I had requested the travelers insurance when I booked, and the agent failed to apply it as requested. If you fly United I highly recommend getting the travelers insurance!! I had to call back, the person that made my reservations, entered my lastname as both my first and last name (another 45 mins on the phone). Then my original booking got changed without notification. I was originally to be routed thru Houston and got routed to Dulles in DC. Then my flight got cancelled while I was in DC, due to weather, which is understandable. The customer service was a very pathetic attempt at customer service. I waited in line for over 2 hours, and there were only 25 people in line in front of me. I was told that there were no flights out to L.A. til 2 days later and that United would pay for 3/4 of a 200+ a night hotel, that was their hotel of choice, I was told they wouldn't pay for anything else. After telling them that was not acceptable, and fly me back home, the person next to her found a flight to LAX for a person behind me in line and I was still stuck in DC. The customer service agent then found a flight out to San Francisco, so I took that flight, because I wanted out of the airport after being there all day. Since San Francisco was not my original destination city, I had to take a Greyhound from San Francisco to Los Angeles. I lost 2 complete days due to travel, between cancellation and not getting a correct flight. This also caused for more money out of pocket to get me to the correct location. I don't understand how they hadn't planned for something, since the plane was coming from Chicago, and it is winter. I was just very disappointed with my whole experience with United. Seating was not designed for people of taller stature, I am 6 foot tall with an athletic build, and could not sit comfortably on any of my flights.

The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner.

Usually my youngest minor child (13) was placed somewhere else on the plane apart from the rest of the family. Having purchased these tickets in February 2015, I find it very hard to believe that the flight was so full at the time of purchase that my family couldn't be kept together.

Then when the gate gets cleared 10 minutes later, they decide to change gates. What should have been a 1 hour layover is now down to a race to go from terminal c to terminal b. We double check the Airport Board to make sure we have the right gate and that the plane is on time. We do, and it says it is. We race to B76 and stand there. And stand there.

On top of all this, I was originally scheduled to go from San Diego to Chicago to Detroit, and the airline changed my flight without my knowledge 2 days before we departed. Because of the airlines delay I was forced to rent a car in Detroit as my arranged transportation couldn't meet us after a 2 hour delay.

Over the months, United Airlines sent me a number of schedule changes and most were not an issues. However, the return flight from OGG to ORD via HNL has become a problem not only because they kept moving the time earlier and earlier (remember, I'm on vacation in Hawaii), but put us on Island Air which only offers economy class and charge for baggage ($80.00 for our 4 bags). This is unacceptable and in my opinion, quite unfair. I called UA's customer service and am so disappointed with the level of customer service or lack of that I received. The agent was difficult to understand due to her heavy accent and was in some ways, quite rude. Take or leave it attitude. Although she offered to move our flight to a different connection through LAX, she stated we would have to pay the difference since we upgraded to first class. How is this right? She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline? She had no answer and again offered to cancel my tickets for a refund. How is this a solution? Her last solution was to call Island Air. Honestly, United Airlines used to be such a great airline - what has happened? Where did customer service go? What benefits do you get anymore for being loyal to an airline and actually paying to maintain a higher status (silver)? We are so disappointed.

We left at 7:30ish from LAX and planned to land in San Antonio around midnight, about 11pm we get notified we're making an emergency landing in El Paso to re-fuel due to a storm and we need to go around it. As soon as we start landing, the lights start flickering on and off. So we land, they can't leave the A/C on because they have to shut everything off to re-fuel. We sat on there for an hour or more while they re-fueled, and then not only to tell us we may or may not be going through the storm but the lights were flicking because the LAX crew didn't charge the battery enough and that sucked all the energy so they're needing to trouble shoot that, but we'll be fine and off in a jiffy. One guy yelled ""what's going on?"" and the lady flight attendant literally ""shhhh""ed him! They kept going into the cockpit with the pilots and coming out with looks on their faces like ""we're screwed"", but they didn't have the decency to tell us anything. When a man asked about what's going on, the male flight attendant said ""well we had to re-fuel to go around the storm, if we go through it, it'll rip these wings right off. I don't think any of us want that do we."" While we are still sitting on there for who knows how long, the man comes back on and says ""Hey guys we know it's hot but it's just one thing after another, apparently one of the engines isn't working so we're bringing mechanics out to fix it, but it'll be fine."" So, they finally get sense to let us off the plane, we take our carry-ons and walk off the plane onto the terminal, walk up another set of stairs into the tunnel and sit in the airport, it's about 12:30am at this point. We sit for about an hour without any word from anyone and then a guy from the airport says we're going downstairs to get vouchers ""just in case"" we can't fly tonight. Clearly, no one wants to get on this plane. We stand around waiting for someone to give us vouchers for about 30 mins. They put our luggage in baggage claim so we can go get it. Then they say we'll have a flight at 7am because all others are full and it's on the same plane.  We could either stay on cots at the airport or get hotel vouchers, but per the airport all the hotels were full. So the next morning everyone is ready to go at 6:30am, we've had a good few hours of a nap. 7am rolls around and no plane. The lady from the night before that was telling us of information of flight ""choices"" and so forth comes and says once again ""I work for the airport not the airline, I didn't promise you a flight at 7am."" When last night, she literally was the one that informed us of everything. So we wait for about an hour plus before a plane that had no one on it magically appears for us to go on. This whole time the airport staff and security was arguing and yelling back and forth at the passengers who were expressing their frustrations.

United,Boeing 787-8,,Aug-15,5,4,"I flew United Airlines from LHR to MCO via IAH in Economy Plus, on their Boeing 787-8. United Airlines Economy Plus product is simply the economy class seat but with an additional 3 or so inches of leg room. The economy plus product is only worth buying if you want that extra room but in my opinion I don't believe there's much difference between that and the economy product. I flew economy back and didn't really find it much different. My wife, son and I are all average height and weight so don't require any extra leg room. The main problem is that the seat is far too thin and as such doesn't provide much support. I know this is a design improvement to lower the weight of the aircraft, but it doesn't help your back on those long flights - LHR to IAH is 10 hours or so. I normally fly business class for work for transatlantic flights (SFO and JFK) around four or five times a year on BA's 747-400 or Virgin's A346 or 747-400 and flying the 787-8 is by far the best craft I've been on. I felt the freshest and the least dehydrated on this craft. In summary, I don't think economy plus is worth the upgrade cost but if you have an extra $150 dollars or so then go for it.",4,7,yes,5th September 2015,"""don't think economy plus is worth the cost""", (United States) ,LHR to MCO via IAH,2,Premium Economy,4,Family Leisure,3,0,0

I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there. Over a 5 hour span, there was no customer service to address any issues. I finally tracked down my luggage and proceeded to customer service to get an alternative flight.

However on this particular aircraft we were given inflight entertainment which was brilliant. You could watch films, TV shows, Music videos, play games, all sorts, and they could be paused and rewinded. However the flight from LA to Honolulu was terrible. This was a 5 hour flight and we were given no food, food was available to buy but it basically cost an arm and a leg. There was inflight entertainment but you had to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. On our 5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco we were, again, given no food, however this time the inflight entertainment was free and was very good. On our flight from San Francisco back to London Heathrow, which was another 11 hour flight, we were given no inflight entertainment whatsoever. Not even a screen. There were communal screens, but what they were showing wasn't necessarily what everybody wanted to watch. It certainly wasn't what I wanted to watch. Overall I felt the flight attendant service was poor. They don't seem to be aware of their passengers. On many occasions when the attendant came by with a bin bag to collect the rubbish, we were just ignored, they didn't even turn to us to see if we had anything that needed putting in the bin.

Upon boarding, we were informed that since my grandson was only 6 years old, he could not sit in the exit row. This information did not appear anywhere on the United Airlines website. He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades. The noise was unberable, and flying into the early morning sun with no window shade was blinding. The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out. No explanation or apology for the missing window shade was ever given. We asked twice to change seats, as ultimately did the couple sitting in the other two premium seats in the exit row. We finally received two premium seats but in separate parts of the cabin. When I asked the FA for a can of ginger ale, she responded that she would first have to serve the other pasengers and would give me the can only if she had any left over. Finally she brought me an opened can with a flat beverage. No other beverage service was offered, nor any food for purchase on the 3.5 hour flight. The disembarking in Toronto was at an off-gate location: we descended down a very steep stairs onto the unsheltered tarmac until our suitcases were unloaded, and were then required to walk on the tarnac for 20 minutes to the Customs area.

Three hours later arrived, but still no sign of an aircraft. Now, the reason for an additional 2 hour and 5 minute delay was ""a late inbound aircraft coming from OH"".

United sells more economy tickets than there are economy seats on the plane and then expects me to either pay more money to fly or spend the night, at my expense, in Durango. They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma.

There is the latest in-flight entertainment system which comes actually with a very small screen. It hung 3 times while watching movies. One more time, it is relatively new but not comparable with modern systems. The service on board (if it can be called service) was the worst service I have had in the last 10 years.

United,,,May-15,2,2,"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn’t it have been nice to receive a message stating “Thank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned miles” ?

United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger.

Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by.

When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection.

I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting.

The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner. This one simple communication act would have taken less than 1 minute.",0,2,,6th May 2015,United Airlines customer review, (United Kingdom) ,,2,Economy Class,1,,2,0,0

We were forced to travel on to Melbourne where we waited on the tarmac for 2 hours until we knew whether we could disembark. It turned out that we did all go into the airport and then were given lunch vouchers. We waited 3-4 hours and then got back on our plane bound for Sydney. I checked to see if I could catch a flight from Melbourne to Christchurch but was told by a UA attendant that there were no more flights to Christchurch from Melbourne I was given a motel voucher for a night's stay and continued on to Christchurtch via NZ Airlines the next day. All in all everything was handled well flight attendants gave extra cookies we were updated frequently about what was to transpire and I think all the passengers were happy that our safety was the most important thing to the crew.,0,9,yes,4th May 2015,United Airlines customer review, (United Kingdom) ,,4,Economy Class,5,,4,0,0

They had to fly from San Diego to Washington DC then to Cancun to make matters worse the weren't even seated near each other!!! How can they do that with a 4 yr old. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed my flight because it took over 1.5 hrs just to check my bag and then was treated horribly. When we finally got on they plane the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever and United in their ultimate wisdom decided that 7 meals would be sufficient for this 5hr 50 min flight.

After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions.

Flight attendants were typically very cheerful and despite the large amount of legs no complications with baggage. Food was fine entertainment on the long-haul flights was pretty good.

The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's. The flight attendants were nice and helpful. The inflight entertainment was good with a lot of the latest movies and TV shows that kept me occupied the entire flight.

United,,,,5,4,LAX to MEL on new 787-9 Dreamliner. This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX.

With only minutes to spare before the cut off time for Pilots and Crew expired we approached the runway for our return to Sydney. We only got half way when the Captain announced we were not going to take off as their time had expired. We were taken off the plane and told to wait until a new crew could be found. Almost 12 hrs later and a frustrating lack of information we were told that finally they had a crew but no pilot then we had a pilot but due to administration problems we could not leave.

United,,,,1,1,"I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice.

We were told to either wait at the airport for 12 hours or we could pay for a motel. In my opinion the motel should be provided if the airline has the ability to just randomly cancel flights.

We sat on the runway in Omaha for 1.5 hrs with maintenance issues and paperwork past our connecting flight departure time out of Denver. At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona. When we arrived in Oahu they had no record of us saying United did not have us booked to Kona. After waiting for everyone to board they were able to get us on. We arrived in Kona approx. 6.5 hrs after we expected to missing a 1/2 a day of our vacation time any activities we had booked and no luggage! Our luggage arrived about 11pm at night. Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long.

Problems happen so that wasn't an issue. But they continued to have us sit on the airplane for 3 hours and got upset when people stood up even though the plane was not moving. After the three hours they confirmed the flight was canceled. They set everyone up with a hotel and a new flight which was excellent. My next two flights were delayed for over 25 min of the original take-off time making people rush if they had a connecting flight. I was not at all satisfied with how the trip went. My one day of travel turned into three days. On the newer planes the seats were comfortable. The staff were always well mannered and helpful. The food and beverages were good and the inflight entertainment wasn't great but there were a few options on the bigger planes. The small planes only had magazines which are not entertaining at all.

Still sitting here when we should have left an hour ago. Why would you not have what is always needed on the plane? It's not a surprise. Why do we need food and beverage when the flight is 2 hours and everyone wants to leave without it? This is poor service poor planning and poor management. We will not be flying United anymore. I have never had this issue with such a short domestic flight. Unfortunately we had to fly United because we had to travel for a funeral and these were the only flights.

Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness.

United,,,,4,1,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not.

Then onboard - crew so grumpy and super senior rude crew. Very limited service and no smiles at all. Crew just wanted to get their job done so they could chat amongst themselves at the back of the Y class cabin.

Even though I wasn't planning on checking in my backpack the plane was so small that most passengers had to give their carry on luggage to the flight attendants to pick up from the luggage claim later. After landing (59 minutes after we were supposed to) the baggage claim carousel wasn't turned on until 35 minutes later! 2 other flights' passengers have landed after us collected their luggage from the carousel next to ours and left. Finally 40 minutes after landing (which is unusual for a domestic flight at a small airport) they started providing our luggage.

The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures.

Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers.

Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties).

They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice.

To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats.

The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.,0,1,,31st October 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United Kingdom) ,,2,Economy Class,4,,1,0,0
United,,,,1,2,United Airlines should be ashamed of itself! Terrible airline and awful customer service! I understand why the airline is the way it is with all the outsourcing being reported on the news. The regional aircraft operating as United Express are old. Those planes are at least 30+ years old! I'm sick of this airline. Always delays cancellations never a flight crew as well as various air traffic issues You spend thousands of dollars with them and they treat there Premier customers as trash.

No more peanuts etc no alcoholic drink with meal (I don't care for it) lavatory in back of seats 25A-C has self-closing lids which would not stay up (the automatic flusher worked). I asked for decaf coffee twice never saw a drop. I tried the attendant call button: it rang and the blue light went on: no one showed up the light went out some time later. The food was close to inedible the breakfast sandwich(?) concoction quite a mess. Why oh why doesn't ANA fly this route non-stop? The tone of the authoritative-voice announcements (recorded) was annoying. The flight was good pilot talk fine landing almost smooth.

United,,,,1,1,I recently finished a mixed carrier trip (United Air New Zealand Virgin Australia). While AZ and VA were wonderful friendly flight attendants decent food (even the stuff for purchase was good) modern planes flights all on time the United flights in contrast felt like traveling in Russia in he 80s. The FAs were angry at everybody and it seems passengers just disturb their peace and are just a huge inconvenience in general. The planes are filthy and old. All my United flights were delayed between 30-60 min and the complete lack of communication in the gate was disturbing.

United,,,,1,1,5.55am flight from Buffalo to DC then to Tampa Sunday 10/12. Ticket agent was in training and I knew we were off to a bad start. After boarding plane they deplaned us because they had neglected to complete the security paperwork. Entire plane missed connecting flights with only two rude ticket agents in DC. Earliest flight to Tampa (I was supposed to arrive in Tampa 10:30 am) didn't leave DC until 5.45pm. They routed me to Chicago to get to Tampa arriving 4:30 pm. Ticket agent neglected to inform me of shuttle from Terminal A to D so I ran the whole way. Got on the plane for Chicago which after an hour was cancelled due to technical problem. Entire plane got off and went to Customer Service with only 3 agents where it took 1.15 hours to finally be booked on the 5.45pm flight to Tampa. With all day to spend at the airport they gave me a lousy $7 meal voucher (didn't even pay for one well-needed alcoholic beverage). When I finally got to Tampa at 8pm my luggage did not which I expected since none of the re-routing agents paid any attention to me when I expressed concern about my luggage.

United,,,,4,4,Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,0,3,,13th October 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Canada) ,,5,Premium Economy,2,,3,0,0
United,,,,1,1,Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.,0,1,,8th October 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Canada) ,,2,Economy Class,2,,1,0,0
United,,,,3,4,We had a great experience with United Airlines on our return flight from Ottawa (Canada) to Phoenix connecting through Chicago O'Hare. Our flight to Phoenix was smooth and on time. The only thing missing was inflight entertainment. Our return flight was complicated by the fact that a disgruntled employee set a fire to a centre governing the flights through both Chicago airports on the Friday before our Sunday departure. We called the United 1-800 number and got through to an agent quite quickly. She was extremely helpful and could not find us an alternate flight with United so arranged for us to take a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Ottawa with US airways. We departed and arrived at a very similar flight to our original flight with United. This was the best service that I have ever received in a difficult situation like this.

The Tucson-LAX portion was fine the flight attendant was very professional and as I was traveling with a handicapped companion she was very helpful. The flight from LAX to Kona Hawaii however was awful. The flight attendants were rude short tempered and often ignored passengers questions. This was a five and a half hour flight to not even provide peanuts as a snack is ridiculous considering the cost of the food available for purchase. I will say the ground crew in Tucson LAX and Kona were fantastic and really went out of their way to help out. My issue is that the ground crew doesn't work for United and I didn't buy my ticket from them.

United,,,,1,1,On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy. We actually managed to sit together on this flight.,0,1,,5th October 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Canada) ,,2,Economy Class,1,,1,0,0

The Agent was amazing and put me on another airline that would get me home to my family. Forever grateful! Once on the plane to Chicago the 1st class flight attendant was very attentive and extremely caring. When I asked if there were any snacks she said that the previous flight had depleted the stock. When I informed her about my birthday flights and the problems I was having she went all out. She offered me her own personal snack out of her purse with a smile. Selfless and sincere. She was a blessing to my day. As I left she handed me a ""care package"" of treats she was able to scrounge up on the plane for and offered me a happy birthday wish.

Food was barely edible for dinner but it got better for breakfast and drinks were forthcoming. Legroom was okay. From the US leg I had to use the kiosk to check in but it refused to print my ticket and required a staff to assist me.

United,,,,1,1,On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible.

Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me.

We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them.

Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,0,7,yes,14th September 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United Kingdom) ,,3,Premium Economy,2,,5,0,0
United,,,,1,1,After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable.

My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol.

I received my first delay notice via email at 10.16 due to late inbound aircraft arrival. The second one came at 4.39 pm while we were at Newark Airport due to same reason however my children and I watched the plane arrive. The plane had tons of cargo underneath. Not just baggage but tons of commercial boxes. Our plane which was originally supposed to take off at 5pm for Houston did not take off until almost 7pm which put us in Houston at 9.30 a half hour after our plane left for Portland. That was just the beginning of our frustration. As I got to the gate and went to ask the United Airline attendant about connections she said ""see the guy down there and he will help you with connecting flight."" She was just telling us what we needed to hear to get us out of her way. By the time I got to customer service at 9.45 United Airlines customer service workers were dropping like flies among a mob of very unhappy people. We are talking 10pm people at one of America's busiest airports. 10.30 I finally get with a customer service worker who gets me food voucher's taxi voucher's and a hotel voucher for a best western 25 minutes away from the airport. She said ""grab some food around the corner"". All food venues were closed. We walked down to ground transportation and were informed only yellow cabs accept taxi voucher's. Finally got a cab and made it to the hotel at 11.30. In short lies and terrible customer service. The cargo was more important than the passengers and the customer service was horrible.

The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service.

Got seat assignment at gate back of the plane. Received lowest Group Boarding number because the gate agent said they order group number based on where you sit. Windows higher middle lower aisle lowest. But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number. Other airlines are based on more you pay more you get. Was already paying max for flight way more than rest because time constraints than other passengers.

As there are 3 of us this time I have to find hotels for 2 nights in a row. One positive that came of this was that United re-routed us to Knoxville via Atlanta using Delta. On the way back from Knoxville via Washington to Newark the United flight was delayed by 2 hours. We are then re-routed from Washington to London then Belfast. It maybe incidental to note that no other airlines had delays at Knoxville that day? At least we get home albeit some 4 hours later than expected.

This made me miss my connecting flight so I had to wait in the huge line to get a flight to Vegas. I finally made it to Vegas about 5 hours later. They didn't apologize or give me anything for the inconvenience. Then the day came for my flight back to Orlando which I was dreading. My flight from Vegas to Houston wasn't too delayed so I figured it was a good day. Boy was I wrong. I arrive in Houston at around 2.30pm only to find out that my flight back home was cancelled and they put me on a flight to Orlando the next day at 9pm.

Bottom line they kept me in a small airport from almost 9am until 9pm and then no flight. I've heard similar problems with this airline.

United,,,,1,1,This week will be the last time I fly United Airlines. I made the mistake of doing a status match program after having Delta status for years simply because I thought that there was better options for flights into my business territory Canada. Today is the final straw in what has been a nightmarish year of unavoidable layovers constant delays cancelled flights and the worst customer service experience possible. I had a flight to Halifax scheduled today. I get to Newark airport for my 2 hour layover and see that my flight is leaving from Concourse A which has no lounge or other comfortable place to get work done. I take the dingy bus to Concourse B/C to use the lounge. While in the lounge I wasted a good hour trying to get Internet to work. I went to the front desk and reported that the Wifi was very slow. The lady behind the desk said that no one else had reported this then went on talking about her vacation pay hours remaining with another United employee. When I arrived in the lounge initially I asked while checking in if they were announcing all flights and was told yes. I did also hear them announce many flights but there was never an announcement for mine. I realized it was 7.05 and my flight left at 7.30. I raced to the bus to Concourse A by the time I arrived at Gate A20 was told that I would not be going to Halifax. I went to the customer care line where I stood for over 5 minutes while 2 agents ignored me. I sat there for almost 10 minutes while she typed away without saying a word to me. Finally she started telling me there was a flight from Houston tomorrow but no seats on it. I heard a passenger next to me say something about a flight to Moncton and asked the agent next to me if there was a flight to Moncton tonight. I asked the staff member to look into the Moncton flight and without saying a word she got up and walked away. Finally got onto the Moncton flight which left 40 minutes late.

The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot).

Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus.

United,,,,1,2,I was booked on another flight after my original flight was cancelled due to Hurricane Arthur. I decided to check- in for this flight as I would have to get up at 5am to catch it. At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA. Flights cancelled 3 times in the last 3 weeks and no-one told me. They have all my contact information and send me my boarding passes and tickets but won't tell me when a flight is cancelled.,0,2,,17th July 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United States) ,,2,Economy Class,3,,1,0,0
United,,,,1,1,"I have been flying UAL for nearly 30 years now but I increasingly find them to be worse and worse. I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured. Attendants told me they could not announce that passengers should be careful of other passengers when loading luggage because it would be a ""deviation from the script"" and get them in trouble.

Spent night at airport since local hotels were booked. Passengers were given a blanket and told to look for a place to sleep. Airport was extremely cold and loud music played all night. Witnessed the treatment from a United Supervisor towards a passenger at the Customer service counter - rude! Prior to this ordeal we attempted to change flight one day earlier but refused to pay the $200 - $300 per ticket. This was our second experience with United and were told that since they were purchased/merged with Continental the customer service has declined.

However the return trip from Moline to Little Rock was a complete disaster! Our flight from Moline to Chicago was delayed for crew time-out. Really? Our flight had been scheduled for over 2 months. Surely that is enough time to prepare for an available crew. Naturally even though we ran as fast as we could not easy for 60+ year old people we missed our connecting flight.

United,,,,1,3,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,0,1,,1st July 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United States) ,,3,Economy Class,3,,4,0,0

Three of the four flights were unmitigated disasters causing terrible disruptions in our plans and incredible inconvenience. To make matters worse it seems as if United is totally focused on the passenger bearing all the downside to their poor execution. We got off a cancelled flight in Chicago ay 12.30 am and were greeted with nothing more than a toll free number to call for help. Not only the most pathetic customer service I've seen for an airline but the worst service I can recall for any business I've been associated with.

Frequent gate changes plus delays required interaction with agents required to arrange connecting flights. 3 times waited in line for over an hour.

I ended up spending the night at the Houston airport. I asked United personnel if I could get a blanket and pillow and was told they did not have any. However the next morning on another Untied concourse there were at least a dozen people on cots - with pillows and blankets! I also was unable to get anything to eat or drink as all of the businesses in the airport seemed to close at 10pm and we arrived at ~ 10.03.

United,,,,1,1,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,0,1,,25th June 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United States) ,,3,Economy Class,2,,3,0,0

Barely made my connection in DFW. Reasons above are easy to fix but I guess not intended to. Why not make your customers happy. Work hard Fly right?

On the 6 flights we were only fed two meals from Heathrow to Houston and Washington to Heathrow. We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy. I asked for a small bottle of water to be told that they did not have enough so could not give me one. They did serve enough drinks on the flights so what were they doing.

Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes.

We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others.

The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL.

The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.,0,1,,5th June 2014,United Airlines customer review, (United States) ,,1,Economy Class,1,,1,0,0

Because of the low price for they tried to put us on a non direct fight for Washington and then to SFO. We finally got scheduled for a flight at 8:30. the airplane was okay. It was an old 757-200 with no entertainment systems or stuff. When we arrived at SFO it was midday and we still had time to explore the city.,0,2,,17th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,2,Economy Class,1,,3,0,0
United,,,,5,4,Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.,0,8,yes,16th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,4,Premium Economy,4,,4,0,0
United,,,,4,4,Reno-Denver-Chicago-Louisville. All flights on time. Late check-in at Reno (my fault) and the ground staff helped to rush me through and make the flight all with a positive attitude and was greeted upon boarding the plane. Each flight was about 85% full so not packed in. Leg room was just fine on the A320 B757 and EMB175. All attendants pleasant with just enough drink runs on each flight. All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it. Maybe I am just lucky but United always seems to work out great for me. Used my air miles so this round trip only cost me $10.,0,9,yes,16th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,4,Economy Class,4,,5,0,0
United,,,,1,4,United airline is a terrible airline for overseas travels. I flew Chicago to Frankfort. Crew were rude and unhelpful. Somebody was seating in my seat and crew didn't support me when I asked her to go back to her seat. I reserved a seat at the time of booking and they sold me the same seat for extra $100! In a 12 hr flight there is no free alcoholic beverage no socks toothbrush or toothpaste. I strongly recommend never fly with united especially for overseas.,0,1,,16th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,4,Economy Class,4,,4,0,0
United,,,,2,3,San Diego to Moline via Chicago O'Hare. When we landed in Chicago I received a text message from United Airlines that our connecting flight was canceled. They rescheduled us for 14 hours later! We live 2 1/2 hours away so we rented a car and drove. Our reimbursement was 1/4 the cost didn't even cover the car rental. No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way. I will never book a flight with United Airlines again.,0,1,,16th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,3,Economy Class,3,,1,0,0
United,,,,1,1,This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off. I also just found out that my flight will be delayed again. I now understand why United is suffering; their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I don't recommend ever flying with this company. Rates are reasonable but it is most certainly not worth the hassle.,0,1,,16th May 2014,United Airlines customer review, (Australia) ,,2,Economy Class,1,,1,0,0
